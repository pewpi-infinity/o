## Executive Summary
Hydrogen is a chemical element; it has the symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest and most abundant chemical element in the universe, constituting about 75% of all normal matter. Under standard conditions, hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, called dihydrogen, or sometimes hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. Dihydrogen is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found as the gas H2 (dihydrogen) and in molecules, such as in water and organic compounds. The most common isotope of hydrogen, 1H, consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.

## Main Scientific Findings
### arXiv Papers
**Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy of Muonic Hydrogen Atoms and Molecules**
Studies of muonic hydrogen atoms and molecules have been performed traditionally in bulk targets of gas, liquid or solid. At TRIUMF, Canada's meson facility, we have developed a new type of target system using multilayer thin films of solid hydrogen, which provides a beam of muonic hydrogen atoms in vacuum. Using the time-of-flight of the muonic atoms, the energy-dependent information of muonic reactions are obtained in direct manner. We discuss some unique measurements enabled by the new technique, with emphasis on processes relevant to muon catalyzed fusion.

**Metal hydride material requirements for automotive hydrogen storage systems**
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has published a progression of technical targets to be satisfied by on-board rechargeable hydrogen storage systems in light-duty vehicles. By combining simplified storage system and vehicle models with interpolated data from metal hydride databases, we obtain material-level requirements for metal hydrides that can be assembled into systems that satisfy the DOE targets for 2017. We assume minimal balance-of-plant components for systems with and without a hydrogen combustion loop for supplemental heating. Tank weight and volume are driven by the stringent requirements for refueling time. The resulting requirements suggest that, at least for this specific application, no current on-board rechargeable metal hydride satisfies these requirements.

**Lamb Shift in Light Hydrogen-Like Atoms**
Calculation of higher-order two-loop corrections is now a limiting factor in development of the bound state QED theory of the Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom and in precision determination of the Rydberg constant. Progress in the study of light hydrogen-like ions of helium and nitrogen can be helpful to investigate these uncalculated terms experimentally. To do that it is necessary to develop a theory of such ions. We present here a theoretical calculation for low energy levels of helium and nitrogen ions.
