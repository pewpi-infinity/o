    <summary>We propose a first-principle method for evaluations of the time-dependent electron distribution function of excited electrons in the conduction band of semiconductors. The method takes into account the excitations of electrons by external source and the relaxation to the bottom of conduction band via electron-phonon coupling. The methods permits calculations of the non-equilibrium electron distribution function, the quasi-stationary distribution function with steady-in-time source of light, the time of setting of the quasi-stationary distribution and the time of energy loss via relaxation to the bottom of conduction band. The actual calculations have been performed for titanium dioxide in the anatase structure and zinc oxide in the wurtzite structure. We find that the quasi-stationary electron distribution function for ZnO is a fermi-like curve that rises linearly with increasing excitation energy whereas the analogous curve for anatase consists of a main peak and a shoulder. The calculations demonstrate that the relaxation of excited electrons and the setting of the quasi-stationary distribution occur within the time no more than 500 fsec for ZnO and 100 fsec for anatase.
  We also discuss the applicability of the effective phonon model with energy-independent electron-phonon transition probability. We find that the model only reproduces the trends in changing of the characteristic times whereas the precision of such calculations is not high. The rate of energy transfer to phonons at the quasi-stationary electron distribution also have been evaluated and the effect of this transfer on the photocatalyses has been discussed. We found that for ZnO this rate is about 5 times less than in anatase.</summary>

    <title>Electronic Reconstruction Enhanced Tunneling Conductance at Terrace Edges of Ultrathin Oxide Films</title>

    <summary>Quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons across ultrathin insulating oxide barriers has been studied extensively for decades due to its great potential in electronic device applications. In the few-nanometer-thick epitaxial oxide films, atomic-scale structural imperfections, such as the ubiquitously existed one-unit-cell-high terrace edges, can dramatically affect the tunneling probability and device performance. However, the underlying physics has not been investigated adequately. Here, taking ultrathin BaTiO3 films as a model system, we report an intrinsic tunneling conductance enhancement near the terrace edges. Scanning probe microscopy results demonstrate the existence of highly-conductive regions (tens of nanometers-wide) near the terrace edges. First-principles calculations suggest that the terrace edge geometry can trigger an electronic reconstruction, which reduces the effective tunneling barrier width locally. Furthermore, such tunneling conductance enhancement can be discovered in other transition-metal-oxides and controlled by surface termination engineering. The controllable electronic reconstruction could facilitate the implementation of oxide electronic devices and discovery of exotic low-dimensional quantum phases.</summary>

    <title>Pt$_3$Zr(0001): A substrate for growing well-ordered ultrathin zirconia films by oxidation</title>

    <summary>We have studied the surface of pure and oxidized Pt$_3$Zr(0001) by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Auger electron microscopy, and density functional theory (DFT). The well-annealed alloy surface shows perfect long-range chemical order. Occasional domain boundaries are probably caused by nonstoichiometry. Pt$_3$Zr exhibits ABAC stacking along [0001]; only the A-terminated surfaces are seen by STM, in agreement with DFT results showing a lower surface energy for the A termination. DFT further predicts a stronger inward relaxation of the surface Zr than for Pt, in spite of the larger atomic size of Zr. A closed ZrO$_2$ film is obtained by oxidation in $10^{-7}$ mbar O$_2$ at 400 $^\circ$C and post-annealing at $\approx 800 ^\circ$C. The oxide consists of an O-Zr-O trilayer, equivalent to a (111) trilayer of the fluorite structure of cubic ZrO$_2$, but contracted laterally. The oxide forms a $(\sqrt{19} \times \sqrt{19})$R23$^\circ$ superstructure. The first monolayer of the substrate consists of Pt and contracts, similar to the metastable reconstruction of pure Pt(111). DFT calculations show that the oxide trilayer binds rather weakly to the substrate. In spite of the O-terminated oxide, bonding to the substrate mainly occurs via the Zr atoms in the oxide, which strongly buckle down towards the Pt substrate atoms, if near a Pt position. According to DFT, the oxide has a bandgap; STM indicates that the conduction band minimum lies $\approx 2.3$ eV above $E_\mathrm{F}$.</summary>
