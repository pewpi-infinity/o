    <summary>  We analyze the ground-state properties of an artificial atom made out of repulsive bosons attracted to a center for the case that all the interactions are short-ranged. Such bosonic atoms could be created by optically trapping ultracold particles of alkali vapors; we present the theory describing how their properties depend on experimentally adjustable strength of ``nuclear'' attraction and interparticle repulsion. The binding ability of the short-range potential increases with space dimensionality - only a limited number of particles can be bound in one dimension, while in two and three dimensions the number of bound bosons can be chosen at will. Particularly in three dimensions we find an unusual effect of enhanced resonant binding: for not very strong interparticle repulsion the equilibrium number of bosons bound to a nuclear potential having a sufficiently shallow single-particle state increases without bound as the nuclear potential becomes less attractive. As a consequence of the competing nuclear attraction enhanced by the Bose statistics and interparticle repulsions, the dependence of the ground-state energy of the atom on the number of particles has a minimum whose position is experimentally tunable. This implies a staircase dependence of the equilibrium number of bound bosons on external parameters which may be used to create a single-atom pipette - an arrangement which allows the transport of atoms into and out of a reservoir, one at a time.</summary>

    <summary>  Derivation of effective zero-range one-dimensional (1D) interactions between atoms in tight waveguides is reviewed, as is the Fermi-Bose mapping method for determination of exact and strongly-correlated states of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atomic vapors in such waveguides, including spin degrees of freedom. Odd-wave 1D interactions derived from 3D p-wave scattering are included as well as the usual even-wave interactions derived from 3D s-wave scattering, with emphasis on the role of 3D Feshbach resonances for selectively enhancing s-wave or p-wave interactions. A duality between 1D fermions and bosons with zero-range interactions suggested by Cheon and Shigehara is shown to hold for the effective 1D dynamics of a spinor Fermi gas with both even and odd-wave interactions and that of a spinor Bose gas with even and odd-wave interactions, with even(odd)-wave Bose coupling constants inversely related to odd(even)-wave Fermi coupling constants. Some recent applications of Fermi-Bose mapping to determination of many-body ground states of Bose gases and of both magnetically trapped, spin-aligned and optically trapped, spin-free Fermi gases are described, and a new generalized Fermi-Bose mapping is used to determine the phase diagram of ground-state total spin of the spinor Fermi gas as a function of the even and odd-wave coupling constants.</summary>

    <title>Methods for Preparing Quantum Gases of Lithium</title>

    <summary>Lithium is an important element in atomic quantum gas experiments because its interactions are highly tunable, due to broad Feshbach resonances and zero-crossings, and because it has two stable isotopes, $^6$Li, a fermion, and $^7$Li, a boson. Although lithium has special value for these reasons, it also presents experimental challenges. In this article, we review some of the methods that have been developed or adapted to confront these challenges, including beam and vapor sources, Zeeman slowers, sub-Doppler laser cooling, laser sources at 671 nm, and all-optical methods for trapping and cooling. Additionally, we provide spectral diagrams of both $^6$Li and $^7$Li, and present plots of Feshbach resonances for both isotopes.</summary>
