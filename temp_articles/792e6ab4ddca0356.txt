    <summary>The mass of stars is enough to confine a plasma to fuse light atoms, but this is not possible to engineer on Earth. Fortunately, nuclear engineering can rely on the magnetic confinement of a plasma using superconducting coils so long as the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) is optimized. This paper will investigate some of the materials which can increase the rate at which Tritium is produced within the breeding blanket layer of Submersion Tokamak reactors, a design that uses magnetic confinement of a plasma in the shape of a torus to execute nuclear fusion. Using the Paramak Python module to model several geometries and OpenMC to run a simulation, it can be observed how neutron multipliers, enrichment, and the neutron energy spectrum affect TBR. This experiment will mainly observe different material choices that have been considered and their TBR based on their cross sections, dose rate, thermal properties and safety. By altering the neutron energy spectrum to account for DD and DT plasma, the difference in these compounds' Tritium breeding efficacy is noted. Neutron energy spectra are an important factor in optimising the TBR levels as the neutrons generated by the fusion reactions in the plasma interact with the breeder material in the blanket and produce tritium through the reaction with Lithium. Since Tritium is a rare isotope of hydrogen that is used as fuel in fusion reactions and has a short half-life, it is essential to produce tritium within the fusion reactor itself. Without the tritium breeding capability, it would not be feasible to generate energy via fusion. A TBR greater than unity indicates that the reactor can generate more tritium than it consumes, ensuring self-sufficiency in the tritium inventory. Since Tritium is the most reliable and efficient fuel for these reactors, optimising the TBR is of paramount importance in the long road to commercialization of nuclear fusion.</summary>
