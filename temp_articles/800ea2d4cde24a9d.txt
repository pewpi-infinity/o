    <summary>The Hamilton operator of an open quantum system is non-Hermitian. Its eigenvalues are, generally, complex and provide not only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. The states may couple via the common environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded. This causes an {\it external mixing} (EM) of the states. Mathematically, EM is related to the existence of singular (the so-called exceptional) points (EPs). The eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure for the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum value. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an EP. At the parameter value of maximum width bifurcation, the phase rigidity approaches the value one, meaning that the two eigenfunctions become orthogonal. However, the eigenfunctions are externally mixed at this parameter value. The S-matrix and therewith the cross section do contain, in the one-channel case, almost no information on the EM of the states. The situation is completely different in the case with two (or more) channels where the resonance structure is strongly influenced by the EM of the states and interesting features of non-Hermitian quantum physics are revealed. We provide numerical results for two and three nearby eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator which are embedded in one common continuum and influenced by two adjoining EPs. The results are discussed. They are of interest for an experimental test of the non-Hermitian quantum physics as well as for applications.</summary>

    <summary>Using techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, scattering properties of Hermitian Hamiltonians, which are related to non-Hermitian ones by similarity transformations, are studied. We have found that the scattering matrix of the Hermitian Hamiltonian coincides with the phase factor of the non-unitary scattering matrix of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The possible presence of a spectral singularity in a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian translates into a pronounced resonance in the scattering cross section of its Hermitian counterpart. This opens a way for detecting spectral singularities in scattering experiments; although a singular point is inaccessible for the Hermitian Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian "feels" the presence of the singularity if it is "close enough". We also show that cross sections of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian do not exhibit any resonance behavior and explain the resonance behavior of the Hermitian Hamiltonian cross section by the fact that corresponding scattering matrix, up to a background scattering matrix, is a square root of the Breit-Wigner scattering matrix.</summary>

    <title>Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance</title>

    <summary>Shockwaves are violent nonlinear distortions of wave motion which have been reported in fluid waves and electromagnetic waves, while here we reveal that a shockwave can occur even in the quantum wave function of a single particle. Specifically, we analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle, and reveal that a strong longitudinal field can rip up a quantum shockwave singularity in the particle wave function, leading to energy dissipation. Moreover, we show that this effect is particularly strong for quasi-relativistic (Dirac) electrons in graphene for two reasons. On one hand, we obtain the single-particle shockwave at very small fields due to the small effective electron mass, and on the other hand we can obtain large dissipation in the many-particle shockwave by using the large electron density in graphene. While the single-particle shockwave can be most easily observed by locating the shockwave singularity with a high-resolution microscopy, the many-particle dissipation would be simply observed as a rapid decay of our resonant electromagnetic field.</summary>
