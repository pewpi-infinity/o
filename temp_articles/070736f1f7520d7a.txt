    <summary>Optimized topology of bi-material acoustic metamaterial lattice plates is studied for maximized locally resonant bandgap of flexural guided waves. Optimized layout of the two relatively stiff and compliant material phases in the design domain is explored, free from any restrictions on the topology and shape of the relevant domains. Multiobjective optimization is performed through which maximized effective stiffness or minimized overall mass of the bandgap topology is additionally ensured. Extreme and selected intermediate optimized topologies of Pareto fronts are presented and their bandgap efficiencies and effective stiffness are compared. The bi-material constitution of selected topologies are further altered and modal band structure of resultant multilateral and porous designs are evaluated. Novel, core-shell like, locally resonant bandgaps are introduced. It is shown that how the bandgap efficiency and structural mass and/or stiffness can be optimized through optimized microstructural design of the matrix and the resonating core domains.</summary>

    <summary>Locally resonant metamaterials are characterized by bandgaps at wavelengths that are much larger than the lattice size, enabling low-frequency vibration attenuation. Typically, bandgap analyses and predictions rely on the assumption of traveling waves in an infinite medium, and do not take advantage of modal representations typically used for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of finite structures. Recently, we developed a method for understanding the locally resonant bandgap in uniform finite metamaterial beams using modal analysis. Here we extend that framework to general locally resonant metastructures with specified boundary conditions using a general operator formulation. Using this approach, along with the assumption of an infinite number of resonators tuned to the same frequency, the frequency range of the locally resonant bandgap is easily derived in closed form. Furthermore, the bandgap expression is shown to be the same regardless of the type of vibration problem under consideration, depending only on the added mass ratio and target frequency. It is shown that the number of resonators required for the bandgap to appear increases with the target frequency range, i.e. respective modal neighborhood. Furthermore, it is observed that there is an optimal, finite number of resonators which gives a bandgap that is wider than the infinite-absorber bandgap, and that the optimal number of resonators increases with target frequency and added mass ratio. As the number of resonators becomes sufficiently large, the bandgap converges to the derived infinite-absorber bandgap. The derived bandgap edge frequencies are shown to agree with results from dispersion analysis using the plane wave expansion method. Numerical and experimental investigations are performed regarding the effects of mass ratio, non-uniform spacing of resonators, and parameter variations among the resonators.</summary>

    <title>Wide elastic wave bandgap metamaterial with single phase constituent</title>

    <summary>Accomplishing a wide elastic wave bandgap with single phase constituent is of primary interest in developing phononic metamaterials. In the present article, exploiting spatial periodicity, a single phase lattice is configured towards achieving a large frequency bandgap in sonic range. Numerical simulations reveal the presence of a comprehensive bandgap of 18 kHz in the 2 to 22 kHz range with systematically localizing the same constituent material in the lattice. Bloch wave modes unravel the involvement of dipole, monopole, and quadrupole resonances for wide and connected bandgaps. The existence of salient bandgaps is experimentally validated by analyzing the mechanical wave transmission.</summary>
