    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>

    <summary>Transition-metal (TM) atom-functionalized nanomaterials are promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their ability to adsorb multiple hydrogen molecules through Kubas interactions. However, achieving efficient hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions remains a critical challenge for practical use. Here, we present a novel approach to modulate the desorption temperature of hydrogen in TM-intercalated bilayer graphene (BLG) using external mechanical forces. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamic occupancy probability calculations, we demonstrate that adjusting the interlayer distance allows for precise control over the interaction energy of H2, thereby facilitating its desorption at ambient conditions. Complete hydrogen desorption occurs when the interlayer distance is reduced below 4.7 Å, 5.3 Å, and 5.1 Å for Sc-, Ti-, and V-intercalated BLG, respectively. Our findings suggest that external mechanical forces can effectively bring hydrogen occupancy to zero by minimizing charge transfer from the TM d-orbitals to H2 antibonding orbitals. Notably, while the total charge transferred from the TM atoms remains nearly constant at varying interlayer distances, its redistribution between the graphene layers and H2 fine-tunes the interaction strength. This approach can be extended to large interlayer distances, as supported by recent experiments on graphene oxide membranes [ACS Nano 12, 9309 (2018)]. Furthermore, recent experimental advances in noble gas and alkali metal intercalation in BLG highlight the potential of this approach to overcome the long-standing challenge of high desorption temperatures in TM-functionalized layered nanomaterials.</summary>

    <title>The route to high temperature superconductivity in transition metal oxides</title>

    <summary>The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates was possible only through an intimate knowledge of perovskite oxides which have been synthesized and characterized for decades at the IBM in the Zürich laboratoty. Especially SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 have been in the focus at IBM as was presented in Volume 1 of a series [1]. Probably for the first time detailed microscopic investigations of the local properties of these compounds have been obtained by studying by means of EPR the surroundings of transition metal impurities in these materials. These experiments enabled the identification of the order parameter of the structural instability observed in these oxides. However, the idea to search for superconductivity came later motivated by theoretical considerations that metallic hydrogen could become superconducting at high temperatures. Since SrTiO3 is an insulator it was thought that the implantation of hydrogen would render it metallic and eventually also superconducting. This approach failed since the carrier density remained always too small. In sequence it was then tried to achieve a metallic state in oxide perovskites by varying their composition which was in so far promising as reduced SrTiO3 exhibits superconductivity at 0.3K [2]. Furthermore it was subsequently shown [3] that Tc can be enhanced to 1.2K by doping SrTiO3 with Nb. In spite of the fact that Tc was far below values achieved in A15 compounds, a remarkable observation was connected with the Nb doped perovskite, namely for the first time long before predicted two-gap superconductivity was realized here.</summary>
