    <summary>  Using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with Acetylene and Ammoniac on Pd-specimens Carbon nanotubes (CNT) could be produced successfully. Two different devices are compared and the conditions for best growth conditions are explained. The detailed analysis of electron diffraction pattern obtained by transmissions electron microscopy (TEM) of as-grown specimen showed an expansion of the Pd lattice, which can be explained by the formation of fcc-PdHx for x=0...1. For x=1..2 the first investigation of hexagonal -PdH2 is reported, which lattice spacing is independent on the hydrogen content. The amount of fcc-PdH and hcp-PdH2 increases when the specimens are treated subsequently with Hydrogen. A growth model is provided.</summary>

    <title>Rapid oxygen exchange between hematite and water vapor</title>

    <summary>Oxygen exchange at oxide/liquid and oxide/gas interfaces is important in technology and environmental studies, as it is closely linked to both catalytic activity and material degradation. The atomic-scale details are mostly unknown, however, and are often ascribed to poorly defined defects in the crystal lattice. Here we show that even thermodynamically stable, well-ordered surfaces can be surprisingly reactive. Specifically, we show that all the 3-fold coordinated lattice oxygen atoms on a defect-free single-crystalline r-cut (1-102) surface of hematite (α-Fe2O3) are exchanged with oxygen from surrounding water vapor within minutes at temperatures below 70 °C, while the atomic-scale surface structure is unperturbed by the process. A similar behavior is observed after liquid water exposure, but the experimental data clearly show most of the exchange happens during desorption of the final monolayer, not during immersion. Density functional theory computations show that the exchange can happen during on-surface diffusion, where the cost of the lattice oxygen extraction is compensated by the stability of an HO-HOH-OH complex. Such insights into lattice oxygen stability are highly relevant for many research fields ranging from catalysis and hydrogen production to geochemistry and paleoclimatology.</summary>

    <title>Diffusion and desorption of SiH3 on hydrogenated H:Si(100)-(2x1) from first principles</title>

    <summary>  We have studied diffusion pathways of a silyl radical adsorbed on the hydrogenated Si (100)-(2x1) surface by density-functional theory. The process is of interest for the growth of crystalline silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Preliminary searches for migration mechanisms have been performed using metadynamics simulations. Local minima and transition states have been further refined by using the nudged-elastic-band method. Barriers for diffusion from plausible adsorption sites as low as 0.2 eV have been found, but trap states have also been spotted, leading to a more stable configuration, with escape barriers of 0.7 eV. Diffusion among weakly bound physisorbed states is also possible with very low activation barriers (&lt;50 meV). However, desorption mechanisms (either as SiH3 or as SiH4) from physisorbed or more strongly bound adsorption configurations turn out to have activation energies similar to diffusion barriers. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on ab initio activation energies show that the silyl radical diffuses at most by a few lattice spacing before desorbing at temperatures in the range 300-1000 K.</summary>
