    <summary>The discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ -- a transition metal (TM) oxide that is both isostructural and isoelectronic to cuprate superconductors -- has lead to renewed enthusiasm in the hope of understanding the origin of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we investigate the electron-removal states in infinite-layered Ni$^{1+}$ oxide, NdNiO$_2$, which mimics hole-doping, with the state-of-the-art many-body multireference quantum chemistry methods. From the analysis of the many-body wavefunction, we find that the hole-doped $d^8$ ground state of NdNiO$_2$ is very different from the $d^8$ ground state in isostructural cuprate analog CaCuO$_2$, although the parent $d^9$ ground states are for the most part identical. We show that the doped hole in NdNiO$_2$ mainly localizes on the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital to form a closed-shell singlet, and this singlet configuration contributes to $\sim$40% of the wavefunction. In contrast, in CaCuO$_2$ the Zhang-Rice singlet configurations contribute to $\sim$65% of the wavefunction. With the help of the quantum information concept of entanglement entropy, we quantify the different types of electronic correlations in the nickelate and cuprate compounds and find that the dynamic radial-type correlations within the Ni $d$ manifold are persistent in hole-doped NdNiO$_2$. As a result, the $d^8$ multiplet effects are stronger and the additional hole foot-print is more three-dimensional in NdNiO$_2$. Our analysis shows that the most commonly used three-band Hubbard model employed to express the doped scenario in cuprates represents $\sim$90% of the $d^8$ wavefunction for CaCuO$_2$, but such a model grossly approximates the $d^8$ wavefunction for NdNiO$_2$ as it only stands for $\sim$60% of the wavefunction.</summary>

    <summary>Wavefunctions constructed from electron-pair states can accurately model strong electron correlation effects and are promising approaches especially for larger many-body systems. In this article, we analyze the nature and the type of electron correlation effects that can be captured by wavefunctions restricted to electron-pair states. We focus on the Antisymmetric Product of 1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) method combined with an orbital optimization protocol presented in [Phys. Rev. B, 89, 201106(R), 2014] whose performance is assessed against electronic structures obtained form DMRG reference data. Our numerical analysis covers model systems for strong correlation: the one-dimensional Hubbard model with periodic boundary condition as well as metallic and molecular hydrogen rings. Specifically, the accuracy of AP1roG is benchmarked using the single-orbital entropy, the orbital-pair mutual information as well as the eigenvalue spectrum of the one-orbital and two-orbital reduced density matrices. Our study indicates that contributions from singly occupied states become important in the strong correlation regime which highlights the limitations of the AP1roG method. Furthermore, we examine the effect of orbital rotations within the AP1roG model on correlations between orbital pairs.</summary>

    <summary>In recent years Quantum Computing prominently entered in the field of Computational Chemistry, importing and transforming computational methods and ideas originally developed within other disciplines, such as Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science into algorithms able to estimate quantum properties of atoms and molecules on present and future quantum devices. An important role in this contamination process is attributed to Quantum Information techniques, having the twofold role of contributing to the analysis of electron correlation and entanglements and guiding the construction of wavefunction variational ansatzes for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver technique.
  This paper introduces the tool SparQ (Sparse Quantum state analysis), designed to efficiently compute fundamental quantum information theory observables on post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions sparse in their definition space. The core methodology involves mapping fermionic wavefunctions to qubit space using fermionic-to-qubits transformations and leveraging the sparse nature of these wavefunctions to evaluate observables and properties of the wavefunction.
  The effectiveness of SparQ is validated by analyzing the mutual information matrices of wavefunctions for the water molecule and the total entropy of $\sim 10^2$ qubits describing the benzene molecule. This highlights its capability to handle large-scale quantum systems, limited mainly by the capabilities of quantum chemical methods used to retrieve the wavefunctions. The results indicate that quantum information theoretical analysis, so far limited to traditional tensor network methods and study of transition operators, can be applied to all post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions, extending their applications to larger and more complex chemical systems.</summary>
