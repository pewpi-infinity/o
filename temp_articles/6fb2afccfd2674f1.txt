    <summary>  Superconducting mechanism of cuprates is discussed in the light of the proximity of the Mott insulator. The proximity accompanied by suppression of coherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in finite-dimensional systems. Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of such differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general point of view. A typical example of the differentiation is found in the flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta $(π,0)$ and $(0,π)$ on 2D square lattices. This flattening even controls the criticality of the metal-insulator transition. Such differentiation and suppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting state in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. The d-wave pairing interaction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence of disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. The superconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is conceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic excitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms. Pseudogap phenomena widely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from the mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively coupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones. When we assume the existence of a strong d-wave channel repulsively competing with AFM fluctuations under the formation of flat and damped single-particle dispersion, we reproduce basic properties of the pseudogap seen in the magnetic resonance, neutron scattering, angle resolved photoemission and tunneling measurements in the cuprates.</summary>

    <summary>We review briefly the properties of a mixture of mutually interacting bosons (bound electron pairs) and itinerant fermions on a lattice (the boson-fermion model). The calculations of the superconducting phase transition temperature ($T_{c}$) and the phase diagram are the main concern. The self-consistent $T$-matrix method is applied to determine the superconducting critical temperature from a pseudogap phase. The method takes into account the pairing fluctuations effects. The $T$-matrix results for $T_{c}$ are given for a 3D cubic lattice with tight-binding dispersion of electrons and standard bosons, and they are also compared with those of the BCS- mean-field approximation (MFA). Our results describe the BCS-Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover in the boson-fermion mixture with resonant interaction. The energy scales involved in the pseudogap formation are also analysed.

    <title>Interplay of electron-lattice interactions and superconductivity in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d</title>

    <summary>  Formation of electron pairs is essential to superconductivity. For conventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established that pairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivative of tunnel current d2I/dV2 corresponds to each phonon mode . For high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity, however, no boson mediating electron pairing has been identified. One explanation could be that electron pair formation and related electron-boson interactions are heterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize. However, with the latest advances in d2I/dV2 spectroscopy using scanning tunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directly at the atomic scale . Here we report d2I/dV2 imaging studies of the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d. We find intense disorder of electron-boson interaction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expected modulations in d2I/dV2 (refs 9,10). Changing the density of holes has minimal effects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating that the bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. Instead, the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of 18O for 16O throughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 per cent - the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibration frequencies. Significantly, the mode energies are always spatially anticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting an interplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity.</summary>
