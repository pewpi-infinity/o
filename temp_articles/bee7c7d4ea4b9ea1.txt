    <summary>Among all experimental observations of cuprate physics, the metal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the pseudogap (PG) region of the temperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic field, when the superconductivity is suppressed, is most likely the most intriguing one. Since it was expected that the PG-normal state for these materials, as for conventional superconductors, is conducting. This MIC, revealed in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy, resistivity temperature upturn, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and Fermi pockets, unambiguously indicates on the insulating normal state, from which the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) appears. In the present work (article I), we discuss the MIC phenomena mentioned in the title of article. The second work (article II) will be devoted to discussion of other listed above MIC phenomena and also to interpretation of the recent observations in the hidden magnetic order and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments spin and charge fluctuations as the intra PG and HTS pair ones. We find that all these MIC (called in the literature as non-Fermi liquid) phenomena can be obtained within the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of single fermions into those of single bosons. We show that this MIC originates from bosons of Coulomb two liquid model and fermions, whose origin is these bosons. At an increase of doping up to critical value or temperature up to PG boundary temperature, the boson system undegoes bosonic insulator - bosonic metal - fermionic metal transitions.</summary>

    <title>Intra pseudogap- and superconductivity-pair spin and charge fluctuations and underdome metal-insulator (fermion-boson)-crossover phenomena as keystones of cuprate physics</title>

    <summary>The most intriguing observation of cuprate experiments is most likely the metal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the underdome region of the temperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic field, when the superconductivity is suppressed. This MIC, which results in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio, nonlinear entropy, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and Fermi pockets, reveals the nonconventional dielectric property of the pseudogap-normal phase. Since conventional superconductivity appears from a conducting normal phase, the understanding of how superconductivity arises from an insulating state becomes a fundamental problem and thus the keystone for all of cuprate physics. Recently, in interpreting the physics of visualization in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) real space nanoregions (NRs), which exhibit an energy gap, we have succeeded in understanding that the minimum size for these NRs provides pseudogap and superconductivity pairs, which are single bosons. In this work, we discuss the intra-particle magnetic spin and charge fluctuations of these bosons, observed recently in hidden magnetic order and STM experiments. We find that all the mentioned MIC phenomena can be obtained in the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of sample percolating NRs of single fermions into those of single bosons.</summary>

    <title>High energy fluctuation spectra in cuprates from infrared optical spectroscopy</title>

    <summary>Coupling of the charge carriers in the high temperature superconducting oxides to bosonic modes has been widely reported using a variety of experimental probes. These include angular resolved photoemission (ARPES), scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), Raman scattering (RS) and infrared optical spectroscopy (IRS). The energy scale investigated has been mostly limited to a relatively small range up to 300 meV or so. Although some ARPES experiments report boson structure up to 800 meV in the dressed electron dispersion curves the data are not analyzed to recover the spectral density of the fluctuation spectrum. We have extended to higher energies up to 2.2 eV the usual maximum entropy technique used to invert optical data so as to obtain an electron-boson spectral density. This has required that we include in our inversions, the calculated (LDA) particle-hole symmetrized energy dependent electronic density of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that significant spectral weight remains in the fluctuation spectra up to 2.2 eV in the Bi-2212 family and to 1.2 eV in Bi-2201 for all doping levels considered.</summary>
