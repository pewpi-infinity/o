    <summary>We report the study of the cocktail effect on superconductivity in high-entropy alloys (HEAs),using hexagonal close-packed HEAs as a prototype system. Compared with the compositional averages of the constituent elements, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is enhanced by from a factor of about 2 to over one order of magnitude. This Tc enhancement correlates with the reduction in the Debye temperature, underlining the importance of phonon softening in triggering the cocktail effect. Furthermore, we show that the Tc in these HEAs is governed by the average phonon frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength, the latter of which scales linearly with the inverse HEA molecular weight and is progressively weakened with increasing mixing entropy. Our study paves the way toward quantitative understanding of the superconductivity in HEAs.</summary>

    <title>Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero temperature</title>

    <summary>We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system which differs with respect to the familiar Schrödinger-like one. From this point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schrödinger equation. One of the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.</summary>

    <title>Large upper critical fields and strong coupling superconductivity in the medium-entropy alloy (Ti1/3Hf1/3Ta1/3)1-xNbx</title>

    <summary>Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.</summary>
