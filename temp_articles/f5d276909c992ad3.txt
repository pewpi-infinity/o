    <summary>  Polarized Fourier-Raman spectra of K, Rb and Tl hydrogen phthalates are studied at the 1064 nm excitation. The frequencies of internal vibrations in hydrogen phthalates are assigned to vibrations of orthophenylene and carboxyl groups. A substitution of K for Rb and Tl gave rise to a small low-frequency shift of vibrations. It is observed the multiband structure of the stretching OH-vibrations due to the fermi-resonance interactions. A number of additional bands are found in the spectra of deuterium potassium acid phthalate. It is suggested that only the partial substitution of hydrogen atoms for deuterium takes place in both orthophenylene and carboxyl groups.</summary>

    <title>Frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber using continuous-wave fields</title>

    <summary>In large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers, photons are the fundamental carriers of information as so-called flying qubits. They may also serve as the interconnect between different components of a hybrid architecture, which might comprise atomic and solid state platforms operating at visible or near-infrared wavelengths, as well as optical links in the telecom band. Quantum frequency conversion is the pathway to change the color of a single photon while preserving its quantum state. Currently, nonlinear crystals are utilized for this process. However, their performance is limited by their acceptance bandwidth, tunability, polarization sensitivity, as well as undesired background emission. A promising alternative is based on stimulated Raman scattering in gases.
  Here, we demonstrate polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber. This approach holds promises for seamless integration into optical fiber networks and interfaces to single emitters. Disparate from related experiments that employ a pulsed pump field, we here take advantage of two coherent continuous-wave pump fields.</summary>

    <title>Generation and control of population difference gratings in a three-level hydrogen atomic medium using half-cycle attosecond pulses</title>

    <summary>Recently, the possibility of the generation and interaction of unipolar half-cycle electromagnetic pulses with quantum systems has been the subject of active research. Such pulses can have many different and interesting applications. They are able to excite quantum systems very fast. Based on the numerical solution of Maxwell-Bloch equations, this paper theoretically studies the possibility of guiding and ultrafast controlling population difference gratings by a sequence of half-cycle attosecond pulses in a three-level resonant medium. The parameters of the model medium (transition frequencies and dipole moments of the transitions) are close to those found in the hydrogen atom. We show the possibility of guiding periodic gratings and dynamic microcavities on different resonance transitions of the medium. In this case, the medium considered is an example of a spatiotemporal photonic crystal. The refractive index varies rapidly in space and time. The possibility of the use of such gratings as Bragg mirrors in ultrafast optics is discussed. The results obtained are of interest in two actively developing areas of modern optics - the physics of half-cycle pulses and space-time photonic crystals.</summary>
