    <summary>Plasma-facing materials (PFMs) represent one of the most significant challenges for the design of future nuclear fusion reactors. Inside the reactor, the divertor will experience the harshest material environment: intense bombardment of neutrons and plasma particles coupled with large and intermittent heat fluxes. The material designated to cover this role in ITER is tungsten (W). While no other materials have shown the potential to match the properties of W, many drawbacks associated with its application remain, including: cracking and erosion induced by a low recrystallization temperature combined with a high ductile-brittle transition temperature and neutron-initiated embrittlement; surface morphology changes (fuzz layer) due to plasma-W interaction with subsequent risk of spontaneous material melting and delamination; low oxidation resistance. This work aims to produce a structured and comprehensive materials screening of PFMs candidates based on known inorganic materials. The methodology applied in this study to identify the most promising PFM candidates combines peer-reviewed data present in the Pauling File database and DFT calculations of two key PFMs defects, namely the surface binding energy and the formation energy of a hydrogen interstitial. The crystal structures and their related properties, extracted from the Pauling File, are ranked according to the heat-balance equation of a PFM subject to the heat loads in the divertor region of an ITER-like tokamak. The materials satisfying the requirements are critically compared with the state-of-the-art literature, defining an optimal subset where to perform the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The majority of previously known PFMs are captured by this screening process, confirming its reliability. Additionally, less familiar refractory materials suggest performance that calls for further investigations.</summary>

    <summary>A metal-oxide film can be used as a hydrogen-isotope permeation barrier in the fuel circulation system for nuclear fusion. We fabricated Er$_2$O$_3$ thin film on a type 316L stainless-steel substrate by using a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition technique for the purpose of hydrogen-isotope permeation barrier. Electron microscopy based imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicate a sound film quality together with X-ray diffraction experiments. We also measured deuterium permeation in the film at high temperatures ranging from 600 $^{\circ}$C to 800 $^{\circ}$C. The permeation reduction was most apparent at 650 $^{\circ}$C. Above 800 $^{\circ}$C, we confirmed that the film was damaged and did not work as a permeation barrier.</summary>
