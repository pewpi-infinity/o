    <summary>A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$, transfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus. The energy lost by electron is more than the energy gained by the nucleus. The resulting energy goes in exciting the atom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon, mercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber experiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper, we study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering experiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth, why muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like lead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the elastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron microscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these phenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give Bloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give resistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and superconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in Fermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures. Electron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions. We turn our attention to electron-proton scattering both eleastic and inelastic, as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and understand the independence of ineleastic cross-section of with respect to transferred momentum. We see, why we can just say that there are three quarks in proton from elastic cross-section. Our main contribution in this article is we are detailed at places, we find literature terse.</summary>
