    <summary>Gravitational-wave now became one of the important observational methods for studying the Universe since its first detection. However, the ground-based observatories have an inherent barrier to their detection frequency band due to the seismic and gravity gradient noises nearby the perturbation of the surroundings. A recent intriguing development of artificial structures for media called metamaterial is opening a new branch of wave mechanics and its application in various fields, in particular, suggesting a novel way of mitigating noises by controlling the media structure for propagating waves. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for handling noises in ground-based gravitational wave detectors by using wave mechanics under metamaterial media. Specifically, we suggest an application of the bandgap engineering technique for mitigating the underground effects of acoustic noises resulting from the seismic vibration in the KAGRA gravitational wave observatory.</summary>

    <title>Black Phosphorus Mid-Infrared Photodetectors with High Gain</title>

    <summary>Recently, black phosphorus (BP) has joined the two dimensional material family as a promising candidate for photonic applications, due to its moderate bandgap, high carrier mobility, and compatibility with a diverse range of substrates. Photodetectors are probably the most explored BP photonic devices, however, their unique potential compared with other layered materials in the mid-infrared wavelength range has not been revealed. Here, we demonstrate BP mid infrared detectors at 3.39 um with high internal gain, resulting in an external responsivity of 82 A/W. Noise measurements show that such BP photodetectors are capable of sensing low intensity mid-infrared light in the picowatt range. Moreover, the high photoresponse remains effective at kilohertz modulation frequencies, because of the fast carrier dynamics arising from BPs moderate bandgap. The high photoresponse at mid infrared wavelengths and the large dynamic bandwidth, together with its unique polarization dependent response induced by low crystalline symmetry, can be coalesced to promise photonic applications such as chip-scale mid-infrared sensing and imaging at low light levels.</summary>

    <title>Interband transitions in narrow-gap carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons</title>

    <summary>We use the robust nearest-neighbour tight-binding approximation to study on the same footing interband dipole transitions in narrow-bandgap carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. It is demonstrated that curvature effects in metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes and edge effects in gapless graphene nanoribbons not only open up bang gaps, which typically correspond to THz frequencies, but also result in a giant enhancement of the probability of optical transitions across these gaps. Moreover, the matrix element of the velocity operator for these transitions has a universal value (equal to the Fermi velocity in graphene) when the photon energy coincides with the band-gap energy. Upon increasing the excitation energy, the transition matrix element first rapidly decreases (for photon energies remaining in the THz range but exceeding two band gap energies it is reduced by three orders of magnitude), and thereafter it starts to increase proportionally to the photon frequency. A similar effect occurs in an armchair carbon nanotube with a band gap opened and controlled by a magnetic field applied along the nanotube axis. There is a direct correspondence between armchair graphene nanoribbons and single-walled zigzag carbon nanotubes. The described sharp photon-energy dependence of the transition matrix element together with the van Hove singularity at the band gap edge of the considered quasi-one-dimensional systems make them promising candidates for active elements of coherent THz radiation emitters. The effect of Pauli blocking of low-energy interband transitions caused by residual doping can be suppressed by creating a population inversion using high-frequency (optical) excitation.</summary>
