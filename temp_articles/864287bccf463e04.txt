    <summary>Graphene holds great promise for post-silicon electronics, however, it faces two main challenges: opening up a bandgap and finding a suitable substrate material. In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate provides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical studies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent experimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density functional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied graphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on the order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect to hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if graphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone) exhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN is due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as misalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is robust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by about 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the graphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate that hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the field effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could open up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.</summary>

    <title>Experimental signature of bandgap opening in bilayer graphene at metal contacts</title>

    <summary>Bilayer graphene (BLG) possesses a finite bandgap when a potential difference is introduced between the two graphene layers. The potential difference is known to be introduced by surface charge transfer. Thus, it is expected that a finite bandgap exists at the metal contacts. The bandgap at the metal-BLG interface can be detected by the superlinear current-voltage characteristics in back-gate field-effect transistors, caused by carriers tunneling through the bandgap. The superlinearity was higher in the positively gated region, attributed to hole doping from the Cr/Au electrodes. The control experiments using single-layer graphene (SLG) did not have a superlinearity, which is consistent with the fact that a sizeable bandgap is not expected at the metal-SLG interface. The opening of a bandgap at the metal-BLG interface is an additional source of electrode-contact resistance.</summary>

    <title>Uniaxial strain on graphene: Raman spectroscopy study and bandgap opening</title>

    <summary>  Graphene was deposited on a transparent and flexible substrate and tensile strain up to ~0.8% was loaded by stretching the substrate in one direction. Raman spectra of strained graphene show significant redshifts of 2D and G band (-27.8 cm^-1 and -14.2 cm^-1per 1% strain, respectively), because of the elongation of the carbon-carbon bonds. This indicates that uniaxial strain has been successfully applied on graphene. We also proposed that by applying uniaxial strain on graphene, tunable bandgap at K point can be realized. First principle calculations predicted a bandgap opening of ~300 meV for graphene under 1% uniaxial tensile strain. The strained graphene provides an alternative way to experimentally tune the bandgap of graphene, which would be more efficient and more controllable than other methods that are used to open bandgap in graphene. Moreover, our results suggest that the flexible substrate is ready for such strain process and Raman spectroscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive method to determine the strain.</summary>
