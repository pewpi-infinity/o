    <summary>Density-functional theory calculations are performed to investigate hydrogen transport in the proton conductor BaSnO$_3$. Structural optimizations in the stable and saddle point configurations for transfer and reorientation allow description of the high-temperature classical and semi-classical regimes, in which diffusion occurs by over-barrier motion. At lower temperature (typically below 300 K), we describe a thermally-assisted quantum regime. In this regime, transfer and reorientation occur when the surrounding matrix adopts particular "coincidence" configurations in which quantum tunneling is favored. Both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic cases are examined. In the adiabatic case, the energy landscape of hydrogen in the coincidence configuration is very flat, with very low coincidence energy barriers. Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations of the H atom in the coincidence potential reveal, in the transfer case, highly quantum behavior up to T=300 K (the density of probability of H in the coincidence configuration, has its maximum at the saddle point, due to the fact that the zero-point energy exceeds the coincidence energy barrier). Arguments are given that support the adiabatic picture for the transfer mechanism. This suggests existence of this state of hydrogen during the very short lifetime of the coincidence configurations ($\sim$ 10$^{-13}$ s), as a transition state for the transfer mechanism. Remarkably, such state is identical to that of ice X, a highly quantum phase of ice observed at high pressures $\approx$ 100 GPa. In the case of reorientation, typical times for existence of the coincidence configuration and for protonic motion are roughly equal, suggesting that the adiabatic picture is not valid. Protonic transfer and reorientation in oxides are therefore governed by radically different mechanisms below room temperature.</summary>

    <summary>In this work, we used a tool of conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method to determine bound state solution of Schrodinger equation with quantum interaction potential called Hulthen-Yukawa inversely quadratic potential (HYIQP). We obtained the energy eigen values and the total wave function . We employed Hellmann-Feynmann Theorem (HFT) to compute expectation values for four different diatomic molecules: Hydrogen molecule (H2), Lithium hydride molecule (LiH), Hydrogen Chloride molecule (HCl) and Carbon(II)Oxide molecule. The resulting energy equation reduces to three well known potentials which are: Hulthen potential, Yukawa potential and inversely quadratic potential. We obtained the numerical bound state energies of the expectation values by implementing Matlab algorithm using experimentally determined spectroscopic constant for the different diatomic molecules. We developed a mathematica programming to obtain wave function and probability density plots for different orbital angular quantum number.</summary>
