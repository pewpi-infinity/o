    <summary>Graphene holds great promise for post-silicon electronics, however, it faces two main challenges: opening up a bandgap and finding a suitable substrate material. In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate provides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical studies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent experimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density functional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied graphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on the order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect to hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if graphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone) exhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN is due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as misalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is robust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by about 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the graphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate that hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the field effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could open up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.</summary>

    <title>Engineering a Spin-Orbit Bandgap in Graphene-Tellurium Heterostructures</title>

    <summary>Intensive research has focused on harnessing the potential of graphene for electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices by generating a bandgap at the Dirac point and enhancing the spin-orbit interaction in the graphene layer. Proximity to heavy p elements is a promising approach; however, their interaction in graphene heterostructures has not been as intensively studied as that of ferromagnetic, noble, or heavy d metals, neither as interlayers nor as substrates. In this study, the effective intercalation of Te atoms in a graphene on Ir(111) heterostructure is achieved. Combining techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, the structural evolution of the system as a function of the Te coverage is elucidated, uncovering up to two distinct phases. The presented angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy analysis reveals the emergence of a bandgap of about 240 meV in the Dirac cone at room temperature, which preserves its characteristic linear dispersion. Furthermore, a pronounced n-doping effect induced by Te in the heterostructure is also observed, and remarkably the possibility of tuning the Dirac point energy towards the Fermi level by reducing the Te coverage while maintaining the open bandgap is demonstrated. Spin-resolved measurements unveil a non-planar chiral spin texture with significant splitting values for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin components. These experimental findings are consistent with the development of a quantum spin Hall phase, where a Te-enhanced intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene surpasses the Rashba one and promotes the opening of the spin-orbit bandgap.</summary>

    <title>Tunable bandgap and magnetic ordering by adsorption of molecules on graphene</title>

    <summary>  We have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene and their modification due to the adsorption of water and other gas molecules. Water and gas molecules adsorbed on nanoscale graphene were found to play the role of defects which facilitate the tunability of the bandgap and allow us to control the magnetic ordering of localized states at the edges. The adsorbed molecules push the wavefunctions corresponding to $α$-spin (up) and $β$-spin (down) states of graphene to the opposite (zigzag) edges. This breaks the sublattice and molecular point group symmetry that results in opening of a large bandgap. The efficiency of the wavefunction displacement depends strongly on the type of molecules adsorbed</summary>
