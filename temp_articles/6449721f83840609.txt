    <summary>We theoretically investigate the spectral property of a biphoton state from multiplexed thermal atomic ensembles. This biphoton state originates from the cascade emissions, which can be generated by two weak pump fields under four-wave mixing condition. Under this condition, a signal photon from the upper transition, chosen in a telecommunication bandwidth, can be generated along with a correlated idler photon from the lower infrared transition. We can spectrally shape the biphoton state by multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency-shifted emissions, where the entropy of entanglement can be analyzed via Schmidt decompositions. We find that this spectral entanglement increases when more vapor cells are multiplexed with correlated or anti-correlated signal and idler fields. The eigenvalues in Schmidt bases approach degenerate under this multiplexing scheme, and corresponding Schmidt numbers can be larger than the number of the multiplexed vapor cells, showing the enlarged entropy of entanglement and excess correlated modes in continuous frequency spaces. We also investigate the lowest entropy of entanglement allowed in the multiplexing scheme, which is preferential for generating a pure single photon source. This shows the potentiality to spectrally shape the biphoton source, where high-capacity spectral modes can be applied in long-distance quantum communication and multimode quantum information processing.</summary>

    <summary>We discuss how greenhouse gases affect radiation transfer in Earth's atmosphere. We explain how greenhouse gases like water vapor or carbon dioxide, differ from non-greenhouse gases like nitrogen or oxygen. Using simple thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that a planet with sufficiently high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere. The planet must also develop a non-convecting stratosphere above the tropopause. In the simplest approximation of an atmosphere that is transparent to sunlight and has frequency-independent opacity for thermal radiation, one can find simple formulas for the tropopause altitude, and for the altitude profiles of pressure and temperature. The troposphere is nearly isentropic and the stratosphere is nearly isothermal. Earth's real atmosphere is much more complicated but it does have a troposphere and a stratosphere. Between the surface and the tropopause the entropy per kilogram of real tropospheric air increases slowly with altitude. The entropy increases much more rapidly with altitude in the stratosphere. The stratosphere has a nearly isothermal lower part and a hotter upper part due to absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by ozone. The thermal opacity of the real atmosphere has a complicated frequency dependence due to the hundreds of thousands of vibration-rotation transitions of its greenhouse molecules. Unlike the simple model where nearly all radiation to space originates at the tropopause altitude, radiation to space from Earth's real atmosphere originates from both the surface and all altitudes in the troposphere. A small additional amount of radiation originates in the stratosphere. When these complications are taken into account, model calculations of the thermal radiation spectrum at the top of the atmosphere can hardly be distinguished from satellite observations.</summary>

    <summary>Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double-Λ configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.</summary>
