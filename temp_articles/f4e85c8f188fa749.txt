    <summary>A simple method is proposed for inclusion of inelastic effects (electron absorption) in computations of low-energy electron reflectivity (LEER) spectra. The theoretical spectra are formulated by matching of electron wavefunctions obtained from first-principles computations in a repeated vacuum-slab-vacuum geometry. Inelastic effects are included by allowing these states to decay in time in accordance with an imaginary term in the potential of the slab, and by mixing of the slab states in accordance with the same type of distribution as occurs in a free-electron model. LEER spectra are computed for various two-dimensional materials, including free-standing multilayer graphene, graphene on copper substrates, and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on cobalt substrates.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Band Structure and Topology in One Dimensional Modulated Plasmonic Crystal</title>

    <summary>Band structures of electrons in a periodic potential are well-known to host topologies that impact their behaviors at edges and interfaces. The concept however is more general than the single-electron setting. In this work, we consider topology of plasmons in a two-dimensional metal, subject to a unidirectional periodicity. We show how the plasmon modes and wavefunctions may be computed for such a periodic system, by focusing on the confined, quantized photon degrees of freedom associated with the plasmon modes. At low frequencies the plasmons disperse with wavevector as $\sqrt{q}$; however at higher frequencies one finds a series of bands and gaps in the spectrum. For a unidirectional periodic electron density with inversion symmetry, we show that each band hosts a Zak phase $γ_n$ which may only take the values $0$ or $π$. Each gap has a topological index $ν$ that is determined by the sum of the Zak phases below it. When the system has an interface with the vacuum, one finds in-gap modes for gaps with non-trivial topologies, which are confined to the interface. In addition, interfaces between systems that are the same except for their topologies -- which can be created by a defect in the lattice in which half a unit cell has been removed -- host in-gap, confined states when the topological indices of the relevant gaps are different. We demonstrate these properties numerically by analyzing a Kronig-Penney-type model in graphene, in which the electron density is piecewise constant, modulating between two different densities. In addition, we consider a related plasmon system modeled after the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We show that the topological phase diagram of the lowest energy bands is highly analogous to that of the SSH tight-binding system.</summary>
