    <summary>We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</summary>

    <summary>  We review lattice evidence for existence of thin vortices in the vacuum state of SU(2) gluodynamics. On the average, the non-Abelian action density per unit area is ultraviolet divergent as a^{-2} where a is the lattice spacing. At small scales, the surface looks very crumpled so that the corresponding entropy factor appears also ultraviolet divergent. The total area, however, scales in physical units. The surface is populated by monopoles which represent a tachyonic mode. The smallest value of $a$ tested is about (3 GeV)^{-1}.</summary>

    <title>The Nambu-Goto string in QCD: Dipole interactions, scattering and entanglement</title>

    <summary>We revisit some aspects of the stringy approach to dipole-dipole interactions, scattering and entanglement in QCD, using the Nambu-Goto (NG) string, without recourse to holography. We first show that the potential between two static dipoles exchanging closed NG strings is attractive at all separations. Underlining the exchange there is an emergent entropy, that is dominated by the tachyon at large separation, and vanishes at short separation, a measure of the confinement-deconfinement transition. The same tachyon is dominant in the scattering amplitude, as a correlator of two Wilson loops for two fixed dipole-like hadrons separated at large rapidity gap, where the contribution of the worldsheet fermions is included. While the tachyon causes the mean string bit density to grow exponentially with the rapidity, the total scattering cross section still satisfies the Froissart bound by quantum shadowing. The stringy scattering exchange also carries an entanglement entropy, that saturates when the bound is reached. For hadrons with varying dipole sizes, the tachyon exchange takes place in hyperbolic space in the conformal limit. The result for the full S-matrix is reminiscent of the one from Mueller$^\prime$s evolved dipole wavefunction, for the total dipole-dipole cross section in perturbative QCD.</summary>
