    <summary>We investigate deuteron-triton (DT) fusion in the presence of linearly polarized strong electromagnetic fields in high-frequency limit, in which a complex spherical square-well potential is exploited to describe the nuclear potential. Within the framework of the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation, we have calculated the total and angular differential fusion cross sections by investigating the asymptotical phase shifts of the Coulomb wavefunctions. With introducing a dimensionless quantity of $n_d$ representing the ratio of the particle quiver oscillation amplitude to the radius of nuclear potential, we find that, even though the tunneling probability of passing through the Coulomb repulsive potential keeps almost identical to that in the absence of electromagnetic fields, the peak of total fusion sections shows an apparent shift from the well known value of 110 keV to 78 keV for $n_d=0.01$. The angular differential cross sections also show some resonance peaks that shift from zero inclination angle to $π/2$ with increasing the parameter $n_d$. The corresponding astrophysical $S$-factors are found to be enhanced by several times in amplitudes. With the help of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximate wavefunctions, the shape-resonance tunneling mechanism of the above findings are uncovered and some implications are discussed.</summary>

    <title>Enhanced low energy fusion rate in palladium (Pd) due to vibrational deuteron dipole-dipole interactions and associated resonant tunneling that over-cancels the Jastrow factor between deuteron pair wavefunctions</title>

    <summary>  We show that interstitial hydrogen nucleii on a metallic lattice are strongly coupled to their near neighbours by the unscreened electromagnetic field mediating transitions between low-lying states. We then show that in almost-stoichiometric PdD clusters, in which most interstitial sites are occupied by a deuteron, certain specific superpositions of many-site product states exist that are lower in energy than the single-site ground state, suggesting the existence of a new low temperature phase. The modified behaviour of the two-particle wavefunction at small separations is investigated and prelimary results suggesting an over-canceling of the effective Coulomb barrier are presented.</summary>

    <title>The Hoyle and associated excited states from the viewpoint of pocket resonances in alpha + 8Be reactions</title>

    <summary>We examine the production of the Hoyle and associated excited states from the viewpoint of pocket resonances in the reaction of an $α$-particle on a ground state prolate $^8$Be nucleus within the optical model coupled-channel framework. The predicted reaction cross sections, as a function of the center-of-mass energy $E_{\rm cm}$, show prominent resonances, including the Hoyle resonance. The positions and widths of these resonances are sensitive to the target deformation ($β_2$ parameter) and the parity of the nuclear surface potential $-$ deeper for the even-parity $L$ partial waves relative to those for the odd-parity $L$ partial waves at the surface region because of the Bose-Einstein exchange of the $α$-bosons. Decomposing the reaction cross sections to different partial waves, we find that the resonance energies and widths reasonably agree with the available experimental data and previous hyperspherical calculations for the $0_2^+$ (Hoyle state), $0_3^+$, $1_1^-$ and $3_1^-$ states of $^{12}$C, except for the narrow theoretical width of the $2_2^+$ state. Analyzing the wavefunctions and the resonance widths, we identify the narrow and sharp $0_2^+$, $3_1^-$ and $2_2^+$ resonances as pocket resonances -- resonances which occur below the potential barrier, while the broad $0_3^+$ and $1_1^-$ resonances as above-the-barrier resonances. For astrophysical applications, we also evaluate the astrophysical $S(E_{\rm cm})$-factor for $E_{\rm cm}$ $&lt;$ 1.0 MeV, for the fusion of $α$+$^8$Be into the $^{12}$C$(2^+)$ state based on our estimated $s$-wave $α$+$^8$Be reaction cross section and the associated $γ$- and $α$-decay widths for the decay of $^{12}$C excited states in the potential pocket.</summary>
