    <summary>We study various mechanisms of electron transmission across the corrugations in the graphene sheet. The spin dependence of the electron transmission probability in the rippled graphene is found. The electrons mean free path and transmission probabilities are analysed for different distributions of ripples in the graphene sheet as well. We demonstrate that the periodically repeated rippled graphene structure (the superlattice) leads to the suppression of the transmission of the ballistic electrons with one spin orientation in contrast to the other, depending on the direction of the incoming electron flow.</summary>

    <title>Edge states, spin transport and impurity induced local density of states in spin-orbit coupled graphene</title>

    <summary>We study graphene which has both spin-orbit coupling (SOC), taken to be of the Kane-Mele form, and a Zeeman field induced due to proximity to a ferromagnetic material. We show that a zigzag interface of graphene having SOC with its pristine counterpart hosts robust chiral edge modes in spite of the gapless nature of the pristine graphene; such modes do not occur for armchair interfaces. Next we study the change in the local density of states (LDOS) due to the presence of an impurity in graphene with SOC and Zeeman field, and demonstrate that the Fourier transform of the LDOS close to the Dirac points can act as a measure of the strength of the spin-orbit coupling; in addition, for a specific distribution of impurity atoms, the LDOS is controlled by a destructive interference effect of graphene electrons which is a direct consequence of their Dirac nature. Finally, we study transport across junctions which separates spin-orbit coupled graphene with Kane-Mele and Rashba terms from pristine graphene both in the presence and absence of a Zeeman field. We demonstrate that such junctions are generally spin active, namely, they can rotate the spin so that an incident electron which is spin polarized along some direction has a finite probability of being transmitted with the opposite spin. This leads to a finite, electrically controllable, spin current in such graphene junctions. We discuss possible experiments which can probe our theoretical predictions.</summary>

    <summary>We analyze spin scattering in ballistic transport of electrons through a ripple at a normal incidence of an electron flow. The model of a ripple consists of a curved graphene surface in the form of an arc of a circle connected from the left-hand and right-hand sides to two flat graphene sheets. At certain conditions the curvature induced spin-orbit coupling creates a transparent window for incoming electrons with one spin polarization simultaneously with a backscattering of those with opposite polarization. This window is equally likely transparent for electrons with spin up and spin down that move in opposite directions. The spin filtering effect being small in one ripple becomes prominent with the increase of N consequently connected ripples that create a graphene sheet of the sinusoidal type. We present the analytical expressions for spin up (down) transmission probabilities as a function of N connected ripples.</summary>
