    <summary>The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates was possible only through an intimate knowledge of perovskite oxides which have been synthesized and characterized for decades at the IBM in the Zürich laboratoty. Especially SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 have been in the focus at IBM as was presented in Volume 1 of a series [1]. Probably for the first time detailed microscopic investigations of the local properties of these compounds have been obtained by studying by means of EPR the surroundings of transition metal impurities in these materials. These experiments enabled the identification of the order parameter of the structural instability observed in these oxides. However, the idea to search for superconductivity came later motivated by theoretical considerations that metallic hydrogen could become superconducting at high temperatures. Since SrTiO3 is an insulator it was thought that the implantation of hydrogen would render it metallic and eventually also superconducting. This approach failed since the carrier density remained always too small. In sequence it was then tried to achieve a metallic state in oxide perovskites by varying their composition which was in so far promising as reduced SrTiO3 exhibits superconductivity at 0.3K [2]. Furthermore it was subsequently shown [3] that Tc can be enhanced to 1.2K by doping SrTiO3 with Nb. In spite of the fact that Tc was far below values achieved in A15 compounds, a remarkable observation was connected with the Nb doped perovskite, namely for the first time long before predicted two-gap superconductivity was realized here.</summary>

    <summary>  We report zero-resistivity transition and the details of magnetic transition of a layered silver oxide Ag$_5$Pb$_2$O$_6$ single crystal, which make definitive evidence of superconductivity in this compound. In the AC susceptibility of a mono-crystal, we observed large supercooling, as well as positive peaks in the real part of the susceptibility indicating the reversibility of magnetic process. These observations reveal that Ag$_5$Pb$_2$O$_6$ is probably the first oxide that shows type-I superconductivity. Evaluation of the superconducting parameters not only gives confirming evidence of type-I superconductivity, but also indicates that it is a dirty-limit superconductor. We also analyze supercooling to determine the upper limit of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter.</summary>

    <title>A second phase transition and superconductivity in the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6</title>
    <updated>2006-10-07T09:46:29Z</updated>

    <summary>  Another phase transition that is probably of first order is found in the beta-pyrochlore oxide superconductor KOs2O6 with a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 9.6 K. It takes place at Tp=7.5 K in the superconducting state in a zero magnetic field. By applying magnetic fields of up to 140 kOe, the Tc gradually decreased to 5.2 K, while Tp changed little, eventually breaking through the Hc2 line at approximately 65 kOe in the H-T diagram. Both the normal-state resistivity and Hc2 change slightly but significantly across the second phase transition. It is suggested that the transition is associated with the rattling of potassium ions located in an oversized cage of osmium and oxide ions.</summary>
