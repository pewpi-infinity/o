    <summary>Being the simplest element with just one electron and proton the electronic structure of the Hydrogen atom is known exactly. However, this does not hold for the complex interplay between them in a solid and in particular not at high pressure that is known to alter the crystal as well as the electronic structure. Back in 1935 Wigner and Huntington predicted that at very high pressure solid molecular hydrogen would dissociate and form an atomic solid that is metallic. In spite of intense research efforts the experimental realization, as well as the theoretical determination of the crystal structure has remained elusive. Here we present a computational study showing that the distorted hexagonal P6$_3$/m structure is the most likely candidate for Phase III of solid hydrogen. We find that the pairing structure is very persistent and insulating over the whole pressure range, which suggests that metallization due to dissociation may precede eventual bandgap closure. Due to the fact that this not only resolve one of major disagreement between theory and experiment, but also excludes the conjectured existence of phonon-driven superconductivity in solid molecular hydrogen, our results involve a complete revision of the zero-temperature phase diagram of Phase III.</summary>

    <title>Large-Size Free-Standing Single-crystal b-Ga2O3 Membranes Fabricated by Hydrogen Implantation and Lift-Off</title>

    <summary>In this paper, we have demonstrated the large-size free-standing single-crystal b-Ga2O3 NMs fabricated by the hydrogen implantation and lift-off process directly from MOCVD grown b-Ga2O3 epifilms on native substrates. The optimum implantation conditions were simulated with a Monte-Carlo simulation to obtain the high hydrogen concentration with a narrow ion distribution at the desired depth. Two as grown b-Ga2O3 samples with different orientation ([100] and [001]) were used and successfully create 1.2 um thick b-Ga2O3 NMs without any physical damages. These b-Ga2O3 NMs were then transfer-printed onto rigid and flexible substrates such as SiC substrate and polyimide substrate. Various material characterizations were performed to investigate the crystal quality, surface morphology, optical property, mechanical property, and bandgap before and after the lift-off and revealed that good material quality is maintained. This result offers several benefits in that the thickness, doping, and size of b-Ga2O3 NMs can be fully controlled. Moreover, more advanced b-Ga2O3-based NM structures such as (AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 heterostructure NMs can be directly created from their bulk epitaxy substrates thus this result provides a viable route for the realization of high performance b-Ga2O3 NM-based electronics and optoelectronics that can be built on various substrates and platforms.</summary>

    <title>Graphenylene nanoribbons: electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties from first-principles calculations</title>

    <summary>Recently synthesized two-dimensional graphene-like material referred to as graphenylene is a semiconductor with a narrow direct bandgap that holds great promise for nanoelectronic applications. The significant bandgap increase can be provided by the strain applied to graphenylene crystal lattice or by using nanoribbons instead of extended layers. In this paper, we present the systematic study of the electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of graphenylene nanoribbons using calculations based on the density functional theory. Estimating the binding energies, we substantiate the stability of nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair edges passivated by hydrogen atoms. Electronic spectra indicate that all considered structures could be classified as direct bandgap semiconductors. The absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, and complex refractive index are calculated by means of the first-principles methods and the Kubo-Greenwood formula. It has been shown that graphenylene ribbons effectively absorb visible-range electromagnetic waves. Due to this absorption, the conductivity is noticeably increased in this range. The transport coefficients and thermoelectric figure of merit are calculated by the nonequilibrium Green functions method. Summarizing the results, we discuss the possible use of graphenylene films and nanoribbons in nanoelectronic devices.</summary>
