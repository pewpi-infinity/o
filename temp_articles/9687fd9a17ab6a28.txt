    <summary>The electron spin-lattice relaxation of TEMPO and TEMPONE was measured at temperatures between 5 and 80 K in crystalline and glassy ethanol using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The experimental data at the lowest temperatures studied were explained in terms of electron-nuclear dipolar interaction between the paramagnetic center and the localized excitations, whereas at higher temperatures low-frequency vibrational modes from the host matrix and Raman processes should be considered. The strong impact of hydrogen bonding between the dopant molecule and ethanol host on the spin relaxation was observed in ethanol glass whereas in crystalline ethanol both paramagnetic guest molecules behaved similarly.</summary>

    <title>Vanadium in yttrium aluminum garnet: charge states and localization in the lattice</title>

    <summary>Vanadium ions charge states and their incorporation in the yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12 (YAG) lattice were studied by the correlated optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. In as-grown crystals, the occupation of the V3+ at both the octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum sites was proven. The V3+ to V4+ charge transformation was observed after annealing in air, whereas annealing in the hydrogen atmosphere resulted exclusively in a slight weakening of the V3+ absorption bands due to partial recharge of these ions. Spin Hamiltonian parameters of the V3+ and V4+ ions at the tetrahedral sites including the zero field splitting and the 51V hyperfine constants have been determined using the high-frequency, up to 300 GHz, EPR measurements. From the analysis of the spin Hamiltonian parameters in the framework of the crystal field theory, the ground state energy levels splitting of the V3+ and V4+ ions were calculated. The charge distribution over the tetrahedral V3+ and its nearest oxygen surroundings was found to be strongly inhomogeneous whereas the tetrahedral V4+ ion concentrated the charge with very weak participation of surrounding ligands. Furthermore, the correlation of the optical and EPR data allowed the proper assignment of the optical absorption peaks in YAG:V crystals.</summary>

    <summary>The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.</summary>
