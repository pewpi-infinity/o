    <summary>  In this paper we consider the effects of resonance and electron scattering on the escape of Lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination. We pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening using a Fokker-Planck approximation of the redistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the Lyman alpha resonance of moving hydrogen atoms. We extend the computations of our recent paper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics of hydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence of the problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to a frequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, and the quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the 3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the Lyman alpha emission profile. We show here that due to the redistribution of photons over frequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by DN_e/N_e~-0.6% at z~900. For the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra this results in |DC_l/C_l|~0.5%-1% at l &gt;~ 1500, and therefore will be important for the analysis of future CMB data in the context of the PLANCK Surveyor, SPT and ACT. The main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoil effect (DN_e/N_e~-1.2% at z~900), while Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening partially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down by DN_e/N_e~0.6% at z~900. The influence of electron scattering close to the maximum of the Thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected. (abridged)</summary>

    <summary>A low pressure discharge sustained in molecular hydrogen with help of the electron cyclotron resonance heating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is simulated using a fully electromagnetic implicit charge- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo code. The simulations show a number of kinetic effects, and the results are in good agreement with various experimentally measured data such as electron density, electron temperature and degree of dissociation. The electron energy distribution shows a tri-Maxwellian form due to a number of different electron heating mechanisms, agreeing with the experimental data in the measured electron energy interval. The simulation results are also verified against a drift-diffusion model and proximity is observed between the computational results for the plasma density at the location of experimental measurement. However, the fluid approximation fails to accurately predict radical density and electron temperature because of the assumption of a single electron temperature. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of hydrogen radicals, whose production is strongly underestimated by the fluid model, whereas it is well predicted by the model considered here. The energy distribution of such radicals demonstrates the presence of a relatively large number of energetic hydrogen atoms produced by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The new insights are of significance for practical applications of hydrogen plasmas.</summary>

    <title>Electron cyclotron resonance discharge as a source for hydrogen and deuterium ions production</title>

    <summary>  In this report, we describe characteristics of a ring-structure hydrogen plasma heated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions and confined in a mirror magnetic trap and discuss the relative efficiency of secondary electrons and thermoelectrons in negative hydrogen and deuterium ion production. The obtained data and calculations of the balance equations for possible reactions demonstrate that the negative ion production is realized in two stages. First, the hydrogen and deuterium molecules are excited in collisions with the plasma electrons to high-laying Rydberg or vibrational levels in the plasma volume. The second stage leads to the negative ion production through the process of dissociative attachment of low energy electrons. The low energy electrons are originated due to a bombardment of the plasma electrode by ions of one of the driven rings and thermoemission from heated tungsten filaments. Experiments seem to indicate that the negative ion generation occurs predominantly in the limited volume filled with thermoelectrons. Estimation of the negative ion generation rate shows that the main channel of and ion production involves the process of high Rydberg state excitation.</summary>
