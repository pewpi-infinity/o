    <summary>  Observed X-ray spectra of some isolated magnetized neutron stars display absorption features, sometimes interpreted as ion cyclotron lines. Modeling the observed spectra is necessary to check this hypothesis and to evaluate neutron star parameters.We develop a computer code for modeling magnetized neutron star atmospheres in a wide range of magnetic fields (10^{12} - 10^{15} G) and effective temperatures (3 \times 10^5 - 10^7 K). Using this code, we study the possibilities to explain the soft X-ray spectra of isolated neutron stars by different atmosphere models. The atmosphere is assumed to consist either of fully ionized electron-ion plasmas or of partially ionized hydrogen. Vacuum resonance and partial mode conversion are taken into account. Any inclination of the magnetic field relative to the stellar surface is allowed. We use modern opacities of fully or partially ionized plasmas in strong magnetic fields and solve the coupled radiative transfer equations for the normal electromagnetic modes in the plasma. Spectra of outgoing radiation are calculated for various atmosphere models: fully ionized semi-infinite atmosphere, thin atmosphere, partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere, or novel "sandwich" atmosphere (thin atmosphere with a hydrogen layer above a helium layer. Possibilities of applications of these results are discussed. In particular, the outgoing spectrum using the "sandwich" model is constructed. Thin partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres with vacuum polarization are shown to be able to improve the fit to the observed spectrum of the nearby isolated neutron star RBS 1223 (RX J1308.8+2127).</summary>

    <title>The Role of Vacuum Fluctuations and Symmetry in the Hydrogen Atom in Quantum Mechanics and Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED)</title>

    <summary>Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED) has had success modeling black body radiation, the harmonic oscillator, the Casimir effect, van der Waals forces, diamagnetism, and uniform acceleration of electrodynamic systems using the stochastic zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field with classical mechanics. However the hydrogen atom, with its 1/r potential remains a critical challenge. Cole and Zou in 2003 and Nieuwenhuizen and Liska in 2015 found that the SED field prevented the electron orbit from collapsing into the proton but eventually the atom became ionized. We look at the issues of the H atom and SED from the perspective of symmetry of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian which is used to obtain the quantum mechanical results, and the Abraham-Lorentz equation, which is a force equation that includes the effects of radiation reaction and is used to obtain the SED simulations. We contrast the physical computed effects of the quantized electromagnetic vacuum flucuations with the role of the real stochastic electromagnetic field.</summary>

    <title>On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma</title>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>
