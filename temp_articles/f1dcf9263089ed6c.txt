    <summary>The results of calculations of the muon transfer rate from the 1S state of muonic hydrogen to the nucleus of a free oxygen atom are presented in the interval of collision energies from 10^(-4) to 10 eV. The calculations were performed within a version of the perturbed stationary states method proposed earlier. The electron screening in the entrance channel of the transfer reaction was taken into account. A p-wave resonance in the transfer rate is predicted at collision energies of about 0.1 eV. This result is of interest in the context of the planned laser experiment on precise measurements of the hyperfine splitting energy of the 1S state of muonic hydrogen.</summary>

    <summary>  We report a first-principles theoretical study of hyperfine interactions, zero-point effects and defect energetics of muonium and hydrogen impurities in silicon and germanium. The spin-polarized density functional method is used, with the crystalline orbitals expanded in all-electron Gaussian basis sets. The behaviour of hydrogen and muonium impurities at both the tetrahedral and bond-centred sites is investigated within a supercell approximation. To describe the zero-point motion of the impurities, a double adiabatic approximation is employed in which the electron, muon/proton and host lattice degrees of freedom are decoupled. Within this approximation the relaxation of the atoms of the host lattice may differ for the muon and proton, although in practice the difference is found to be slight. With the inclusion of zero-point motion the tetrahedral site is energetically preferred over the bond-centred site in both silicon and germanium. The hyperfine and superhyperfine parameters, calculated as averages over the motion of the muon, agree reasonably well with the available data from muon spin resonance experiments.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen Diffusion and Trapping in α-Iron: The Role of Quantum and Anharmonic Fluctuations</title>
    <updated>2018-03-01T19:46:38Z</updated>

    <summary>We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic α-iron, taking account of the quantum fluctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.</summary>
