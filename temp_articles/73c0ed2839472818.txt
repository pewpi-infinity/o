    <summary>The present research work is focused on the effect of activation procedure on the hydrogen absorption-desorption properties of new rare earth transition metal compound based on Sm(Co0.6Fe0.2Zr0.16B0.04)7.5 composition. Crystal structure and composition is always connected to the maximum capacity of the intermetallic hydrides. For composite materials the thermodynamic properties of hydrogenation &amp; dehydrogenation procedure are mostly explained through microstructure-microchemistry characteristics. Efficient hydrogen storage is direct connected to the desorbed hydrogen amount. The as hydrogenated material Sm(Co0.6Fe0.2Zr0.16B0.04)7.5 seems to have in the desorption a pressure plateau below the atmospheric pressure at room temperature while the absorbed hydrogen almost remains in the material having capacity of ~0.8 wt. % at 0.1 MPa - 30 oC. After the proper activation procedure, the hydrogenated material desorbs very high amount of hydrogen ~1.9 wt. % at 0.1 MPa - 100 oC. Subsequently, the treatment of the composite materials before hydrogenation &amp; dehydrogenation procedures could play a crucial role on the efficiency.</summary>

    <summary>A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 Å to 8.082 Å, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.</summary>

    <summary>Vapor growth of semiconductors is analyzed using recently obtained dependence of the adsorption energy on the electron charge transfer between the surface adsorbed species and the bulk [Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 114 (2013) 063507, Kempisty et al. ArXiv 1307.5778 (2013)]. Ab initio calculations were performed to study the physical properties of GaN(0001) surface in ammonia-rich conditions, i.e. covered by mixture of NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals. The Fermi level is pinned at valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) for full coverage by NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals, respectively. For the crossover content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer (ML), the Fermi level is unpinned. It was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping in the bulk for the unpinned Fermi level, i.e. for this coverage. Surface structure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and compared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by determination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial pressure steeply increases with NH3 content to attain the crossover NH3/NH2 coverage, i.e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition the entire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor growth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level at the surface, i.e. for flat bands. Accordingly, adsorption energy of most species depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible molecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of semiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk</summary>
