    <summary>  It is shown that the superconducting intermetallic compound MgB2 possesses a narrow, partly filled "superconducting band" with Wannier functions of special symmetry in its band structure. This result corroborates previous observations about the band structures of numerous superconductors and non-superconductors showing that evidently superconductivity is always connected with such superconducting bands. These findings are interpreted in the framework of a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model. Within this new group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow superconducting bands. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconducting band is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a conventional low-Tc or a high-Tc superconductor. This interpretation provides the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.</summary>

    <summary>  We investigate the dynamics of the spin-boson model when the spectral density of the boson bath shows a resonance at a characteristic frequency $Ω$ but behaves Ohmically at small frequencies. The time evolution of an initial state is determined by making use of the mapping onto a system composed of a quantum mechanical two-state system (TSS) which is coupled to a harmonic oscillator (HO) with frequency $Ω$. The HO itself is coupled to an Ohmic environment. The dynamics is calculated by employing the numerically exact quasiadiabatic path-integral propagator technique. We find significant new properties compared to the Ohmic spin-boson model. By reducing the TSS-HO system in the dressed states picture to a three-level system for the special case at resonance, we calculate the dephasing rates for the TSS analytically. Finally, we apply our model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to an underdamped dc-SQUID detector.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity mediated by charge fluctuations in layered molecular crystals</title>

    <summary>  In elemental metals the pairing of electrons leading to superconductivity is mediated by the vibrations of the crystal lattice and the pairs have spherical symmetry. For layered organic molecular crystals there is no consensus about the pairing symmetry or the mechanism of the superconductivity. We show theoretically that the mechanism of superconductivity for members of the (BEDT-TTF)2X family with the theta and beta'' crystal structures is mediated by charge fluctuations and the superconducting order parameter has dxy symmetry. This is in contrast to the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X family, for which theoretical calculations give superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations and with dx2-y2 symmetry. Our conclusions are based on systematic many-body calculations using slave-boson theory of an extended Hubbard model. This is the simplest model that can describe the competition between metallic, superconducting, insulating, and charge ordered phases that occurs in the theta and beta'' materials. Based on the theory presented we predict several materials that should become superconducting under pressure.</summary>
