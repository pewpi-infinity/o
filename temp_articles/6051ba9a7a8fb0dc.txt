    <summary>  I review scenarios for the assembly of supermassive black holes (MBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the dark matter halo "merger tree". Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a LCDM cosmology, coupled to semi-analytical recipes, are a powerful tool to follow the merger history of halos and the dynamics and growth of the MBHs they host. X-ray photons from miniquasars powered by intermediate-mass "seed" holes may permeate the universe more uniformly than EUV radiation, make the low-density diffuse intergalactic medium warm and weakly ionized prior to the epoch of reionization breakthrough, and set an entropy floor. The spin distribution of MBHs is determined by gas accretion, and is predicted to be heavily skewed towards fast-rotating Kerr holes, to be already in place at early epochs, and not to change significantly below redshift 5. Decaying MBH binaries may shape the innermost central regions of galaxies and should be detected in significant numbers by LISA.</summary>

    <summary>The Rietveld refinement of the polycrystalline powders of 1% Fe and Mn-doped (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.94Ba0.06Ti0.98V0.02O3 at the Ti-site confirmed a single rhombohedral (R3c) phase. The bandgap, (Eg) was affected by the anti-phase octahedral tilt angle and the spin-orbit splitting energy of Ti4+2p3/2 and Ti4+2p1/2 states. The decrease in Bi loss and increase in the binding energy of Ba due to Fe/Mn doping has been correlated to the strengthening of Bi-O and Ba-O bonds which was revealed from the XPS studies thereby further related to the average A-O bond length from structural studies. Hence, a reduction of oxygen vacancy (VO) for the doped samples has been justified. A significant improvement of the dielectric constant, relaxation time (τ0), and the decrease in conductivity due to doping was revealed from the frequency-dependent (10Hz-1MHz) dielectric measurement study. The conduction and relaxation process is dominated by the short-range movement of defects. The activation energy (Ea ~1eV) revealed that there is a presence of double-ionized VOs. The ECE study showed a significant enhancement of the changes in entropy, and the adiabatic temperature difference due to doping, with the change in tempearture being highest in the Fe-doped sample. Such improvement of dielectric and ECE properties was confirmed due to the reduction of the mobility of oxygen vacancy because of the formation defect dipoles.</summary>
