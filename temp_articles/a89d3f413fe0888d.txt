    <summary>The Rényi entanglement entropy (REE) of the states excited by local operators in two-dimensional irrational conformal field theories (CFTs), especially in Liouville field theory (LFT) and $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Liouville field theory (SLFT), has been investigated. In particular, the excited states obtained by acting on the vacuum with primary operators were considered. {We start from evaluating the second REE in a compact $c=1$ free boson field theory at generic radius, which is an irrational CFT. Then we focus on the two special irrational CFTs, e.g., LFT and SLFT. In these theories, the second REE of such local excited states becomes divergent in early and late time limits. For simplicity, we study the memory effect of REE for the two classes of the local excited states in LFT and SLFT. In order to restore the quasiparticles picture, we define the difference of REE between target and reference states, which belong to the same class. The variation of the difference of REE between early and late time limits always coincides with the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between target and reference states. Furthermore, the locally excited states by acting generic descendent operators on the vacuum have been also investigated. The variation of the difference of REE is the summation of the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between the target and reference states, and an additional normalization factor. Since the identity operator (or vacuum state) does not live in the Hilbert space of LFT and SLFT and no discrete terms contribute to REE in the intermediate channel, the variation of the difference of REE between target and reference states is no longer the log of the quantum dimension which is shown in the 1+1-dimensional rational CFTs (RCFTs).</summary>

    <summary>We propose a neural network training method capable of accounting for the effects of systematic variations of the data model in the training process and describe its extension towards neural network multiclass classification. The procedure is evaluated on the realistic case of the measurement of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the $ττ$ decay channel at the CMS experiment. The neural network output functions are used to infer the signal strengths for inclusive production of Higgs bosons as well as for their production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. We observe improvements of 12 and 16% in the uncertainty in the signal strengths for gluon and vector-boson fusion, respectively, compared with a conventional neural network training based on cross-entropy.</summary>

    <title>Identifying Non-Abelian Topological Order through Minimal Entangled States</title>

    <summary>The topological order is equivalent to the pattern of long-range quantum entanglements, which cannot be measured by any local observable. Here we perform an exact diagonalization study to establish the non-Abelian topological order through entanglement entropy measurement. We focus on the quasiparticle statistics of the non-Abelian Moore-Read and Read-Rezayi states on the lattice boson models. We identify multiple independent minimal entangled states (MESs) in the groundstate manifold on a torus. The extracted modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix from MESs faithfully demonstrates the Majorana quasiparticle or Fibonacci quasiparticle statistics, including the quasiparticle quantum dimensions and the fusion rules for such systems. These findings support that MESs manifest the eigenstates of quasiparticles for the non-Abelian topological states and encode the full information of the topological order.</summary>
