    <summary>  In this paper we consider the effects of resonance and electron scattering on the escape of Lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination. We pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening using a Fokker-Planck approximation of the redistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the Lyman alpha resonance of moving hydrogen atoms. We extend the computations of our recent paper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics of hydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence of the problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to a frequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, and the quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the 3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the Lyman alpha emission profile. We show here that due to the redistribution of photons over frequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by DN_e/N_e~-0.6% at z~900. For the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra this results in |DC_l/C_l|~0.5%-1% at l &gt;~ 1500, and therefore will be important for the analysis of future CMB data in the context of the PLANCK Surveyor, SPT and ACT. The main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoil effect (DN_e/N_e~-1.2% at z~900), while Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening partially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down by DN_e/N_e~0.6% at z~900. The influence of electron scattering close to the maximum of the Thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected. (abridged)</summary>

    <title>Hyperfine frequency shift in two-dimensional atomic hydrogen</title>

    <summary>  We propose the explanation of a surprisingly small hyperfine frequency shift in the two-dimensional (2D) atomic hydrogen bound to the surface of superfluid helium below 0.1 K. Owing to the symmetry considerations, the microwave-induced triplet-singlet transitions of atomic pairs in the fully spin-polarized sample are forbidden. The apparent nonzero shift is associated with the density-dependent wall shift of the hyperfine constant and the pressure shift due to the presence of H atoms in the hyperfine state $a$ not involved in the observed $b\to c$ transition. The interaction of adsorbed atoms with one another effectively decreases the binding energy and, consequently, the wall shift by the amount proportional to their density. The pressure shift of the $b\to c$ resonance comes from the fact that the impurity $a$-state atoms interact differently with the initial $b$-state and final $c$-state atoms and is also linear in density. The net effect of the two contributions, both specific for 2D hydrogen, is comparable with the experimental observation. To our knowledge, this is the first mentioning of the density-dependent wall shift. We also show that the difference between the triplet and singlet scattering lengths of H atoms, $a_t-a_s=30(5)$ pm, is exactly twice smaller than the value reported by Ahokas {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf101}, 263003 (2008).</summary>

    <title>Frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber using continuous-wave fields</title>

    <summary>In large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers, photons are the fundamental carriers of information as so-called flying qubits. They may also serve as the interconnect between different components of a hybrid architecture, which might comprise atomic and solid state platforms operating at visible or near-infrared wavelengths, as well as optical links in the telecom band. Quantum frequency conversion is the pathway to change the color of a single photon while preserving its quantum state. Currently, nonlinear crystals are utilized for this process. However, their performance is limited by their acceptance bandwidth, tunability, polarization sensitivity, as well as undesired background emission. A promising alternative is based on stimulated Raman scattering in gases.
  Here, we demonstrate polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber. This approach holds promises for seamless integration into optical fiber networks and interfaces to single emitters. Disparate from related experiments that employ a pulsed pump field, we here take advantage of two coherent continuous-wave pump fields.</summary>
