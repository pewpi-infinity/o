    <summary>In 1980 Binnig et al. reported tunneling measurements on Nb-doped SrTiO3, and interpreted their results as indicating two-band superconductivity in the bulk of SrTiO3. However: (1) Effective masses determined from tunneling results in the normal state by Sroubek in 1969 and 1970 are much smaller than those determined by most other methods. The much smaller masses were attributed to properties of a surface layer by the present author in 1971; (2) The only other reports of two-band superconductivity in bulk SrTiO3 can be used to infer much smaller values of band separations than found by Binnig et al.. In this paper we give an alternative explanation of the results of Binnig et al. in terms of superconductivity in a surface layer. We obtain fair fits to the band gaps versus Fermi energy for the two bands in three samples where two surface subbands are occupied and to the temperature dependence of the gaps in one crystal, using a model with three adjustable interaction parameters, an adjustable energy for the phonons which dominate the pairing, and an adjustable ratio for the mean-field Tc to the actual Tc. We show results for a combined fit to the low-temoerature band gaps and to the T-dependence in one crystal. The phonon energy which gives the best fit is 21 meV. This is probably an appropriate average over the three longitudinal polar modes and acoustic modes in the material. A large value of about two is found for the ratio T_(cmf}/Tc, and we conjecture that this arises because a band with a small Fermi energy not seen in the tunneling results plays a part in increasing T_{cmf}/Tc.</summary>

    <summary>  We report on the synthesis of superconducting single crystals of FeSe, and their characterization by X-ray diffraction, magnetization and resistivity. We have performed ac susceptibility measurements under high pressure in a hydrostatic liquid argon medium up to 14 GPa and we find that TC increases up to 33-36 K in all samples, but with slightly different pressure dependences on different samples. Above 12 GPa no traces of superconductivity are found in any sample. We have also performed a room temperature high pressure X-ray diffraction study up to 12 GPa on a powder sample, and we find that between 8.5 GPa and 12 GPa, the tetragonal PbO structure undergoes a structural transition to a hexagonal structure. This transition results in a volume decrease of about 16%, and is accompanied by the appearance of an intermediate, probably orthorhombic phase.</summary>

    <summary>  The mechanism of superconductivity caused by the electron-vibrational centres and their inherent oscillations in crystals and solid-state structures near room temperature and at higher temperatures - hyperconductivity is discussed and actualized. The experimental data about hiperconductivity in some materials are presented. Hyperconductivity arises and exists from normal-superconducting transition temperature Tc to 800K and probably up to melting of material (probably up to temperature of crystal melting and is higher). Tc in various materials varies from hundred up to several hundreds degrees on Kelvin scale depending on size of average nuclear number of a material.</summary>
