    <summary>Using a Green's function approach, we study phonon-mediated superconducting pairing symmetries that may arise in bilayer graphene where the monolayers are displaced in-plane with respect to each other. We consider a generic coupling potential between the displaced graphene monolayers, which is applicable to both shifted and commensurate twisted graphene layers; study intralayer and interlayer phonon-mediated BCS pairings; and investigate AA and AB(AC) stacking orders. Our findings demonstrate that at the charge neutrality point, the dominant pairings in both AA and AB stackings with intralayer and interlayer electron-electron couplings can have even-parity $s$-wave class and odd-parity $p$-wave class of symmetries with the possibility of invoking equal-pseudospin and odd-frequency pair correlations. At a finite doping, however, the AB (and equivalently AC) stacking can develop pseudospin-singlet and pseudospin-triplet $d$-wave symmetry, in addition to $s$-wave, $p$-wave, $f$-wave, and their combinations, while the AA stacking order, similar to the undoped case, is unable to host the $d$-wave symmetry. When we introduce a generic coupling potential, applicable to commensurate twisted and shifted bilayers of graphene, $d$-wave symmetry can also appear at the charge neutrality point. Inspired by a recent experiment where two phonon modes were observed in a twisted bilayer graphene, we also discuss the possibility of the existence of two-gap superconductivity, where the intralayer and interlayer phonon-mediated BCS picture is responsible for superconductivity. These analyses may provide a useful tool in determining the superconducting pairing symmetries and mechanism in bilayer graphene systems.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity in Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene: C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$</title>

    <summary>The deposition and intercalation of metal atoms can induce superconductivity in monolayer and bilayer graphenes. For example, it has been experimentally proved that Li-deposited graphene is a superconductor with critical temperature $T_{c}$ of 5.9 K, Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$ and K-intercalated epitaxial bilayer graphene C$_{8}$KC$_{8}$ are superconductors with $T_{c}$ of 2-4 K and 3.6 K, respectively. However, the $T_{c}$ of them are relatively low. To obtain higher $T_{c}$ in graphene-based superconductors, here we predict a new Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, which shows higher Ca concentration than the C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$. It is proved to be thermodynamically and dynamically stable. The electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and superconductivity of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ are investigated based on first-principles calculations. The EPC of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ mainly comes from the coupling between the electrons of C-$p_{z}$ orbital and the high- and low-frequency vibration modes of C atoms. The calculated EPC constant $λ$ of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ is 0.75, and the superconducting $T_{c}$ is 18.9 K, which is much higher than other metal-intercalated bilayer graphenes. By further applying -4\% biaxial compressive strain to C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, the $T_{c}$ can be boosted to 26.6 K. Thus, the predicted C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ provides a new platform for realizing superconductivity with the highest $T_{c}$ in bilayer graphenes.</summary>

    <title>Triplet proximity effect and odd-frequency pairing in graphene</title>

    <summary>We study the interplay between proximity-induced superconductivity and ferromagnetism in graphene by self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations on the honeycomb lattice. We find that a strong triplet proximity effect is generated in graphene, leading to odd-frequency pairing correlations. These odd-frequency correlations are clearly manifested in the local density of states of the graphene sheet, which can be probed via STM-measurements. Motivated by recent experiments on S$\mid$N$\mid$S graphene Josephson junctions, we also study the spectrum of Andreev-bound states formed in the normal region due to the proximity effect. Our results may be useful for interpreting spectroscopic data and can also serve as a guideline for future experiments.</summary>
