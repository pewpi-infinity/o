    <summary>The Dirac equation is reinterpreted as a constitutive equation for singularities in the electromagnetic vacuum, with the electron as a point singularity on a lightlike toroidal vortex. The diameter of the vortex is a Compton wavelength and its thickness is given by the electron's anomalous magnetic moment. The photon is modeled as an electron-positron pair trapped in a vortex with energy proportional to the photon frequency. The possibility that all elementary particles are composed of similar vortices is discussed.</summary>

    <summary>The internal stability of the electron has been debated for a century at both the classical and the quantum level. Recently, a local force density balance was established for the 1s electron in the H atom, based on the energy-momentum tensor of the classical Dirac field. This methodology is now extended to quantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum polarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any charged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal structure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization induced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point charge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and degeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are balanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The force densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac sea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha, the force densities remain balanced. This result establishes a local force balance for a prototypical manybody system.</summary>

    <title>Theory of classical electrodynamics with topologically quantized singularities as electric charges</title>
    <updated>2023-11-24T12:59:06Z</updated>

    <summary>We formulate a theory of classical electrodynamics where the only admissible electric charges are topological singularities in the electromagnetic field, and charge quantization is accounted by the Chern theorem, such that Dirac magnetic monopoles are not needed. The theory allows positive and negative charges of equal magnitude, where the sign of the charge corresponds to the chirality of the topological singularity. Given the trajectory ${\bf w}(t)$ of the singularity, one can calculate electric and magnetic fields identical to those produced by Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge, apart from a multiplicative constant factor related to electron charge and vacuum permittivity. The theory is based on the relativistic Weyl equation in frequency-wavevector space, with eigenstates comprising the position, velocity, and acceleration of the singularity, and eigenvalues defining the retarded position of the charge. From the eigenstates we calculate the Berry connection and the Berry curvatures, and identify the curvatures as electric and magnetic fields.</summary>
