    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>

    <title>Enhanced superconductivity of hydrogenated $β_{12}$ borophene</title>

    <summary>Borophene stands out among elemental two-dimensional materials due to its extraordinary physical properties, including structural polymorphism, strong anisotropy, metallicity, and the potential for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, confirming superconductivity in borophene experimentally has been evasive to date, mainly due to the detrimental effects of metallic substrates and its susceptibility to oxidation. In this study, we present an \textit{ab initio} analysis of superconductivity in the experimentally synthesized hydrogenated $β_{12}$ borophene, which has been proven to be less prone to oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that hydrogenation significantly enhances both the stability and superconducting properties of $β_{12}$ borophene. Furthermore, we reveal that tensile strain and hole doping, achievable through various experimental methods, significantly enhance the critical temperature, reaching up to 29 K. These findings not only promote further fundamental research on superconducting borophene and its heterostructures, but also position hydrogenated borophene as a versatile platform for low-dimensional superconducting electronics.</summary>

    <summary>  The effect of doping with hydrogen on the electrical properties of vanadium oxide is studied. For vanadium oxide films, subject to cold hydrogen plasma treatment, the temperature dependence of resistance with a maximum at T ~ 100 K is observed. Also, the dependence of the a.c. resistance on frequency is studied. A strategy for fabrication new superconducting materials is discussed.</summary>
