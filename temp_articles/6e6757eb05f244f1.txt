    <summary>The transition mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors is an outstanding puzzle. A previous suggestion on the role of non-linear local lattice instability modes on the microscopic pairing mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors \cite{Lee:JSNM09} is re-examined to provide a viable mechanism for superconductivity in these cuprates via an unusual lattice vibration in which an electron is predominantly interacting with a nonlinear $Q_2$ mode of the oxygen clusters in the CuO$_2$ planes. It is shown that the interaction has explicit d-wave symmetry and leads to an indirect coupling of d-wave symmetry between electrons. As a follow-up of \cite{Lee:JSNM09}, in this paper, we report detailed derivation of the superconducting gap equation and numerical solutions for the transition temperature as inherently integrated into the so-called Extended Hubbard Model (EHM). A unique feature in the EHM is that the transition temperature has an inherent k-dependence. In addition, superconducting gap solutions are restrained to specific regions in the first Brillouin zone (1BZ). It is very feasible to expect that the EHM naturally inherits a huge parameter space in which experimentally measured results, such as the well-known superconducting dome and the phase diagram from electronic Raman scattering \cite{Sacuto:RPP13} can be accommodated. The EHM model hence offers a viable venue to search for or confirm any signature in k-point-sensitive experimental measurements.</summary>

    <title>Electronic states in superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal: 1T-PdSeTe</title>

    <summary>We have investigated the surface and bulk electronic structures of the superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal 1T-PdSeTe. The superconducting transition temperature $T_C = 3.2$ K was almost twice as high as $T_C = 1.6$ K in 1T-PdTe$_2$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements showed homogeneously mixed Se and Te atoms in the chalcogen layers, consistent with the CdI$_2$-type crystal structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations indicated the existence of the topological surface states, and the overall band structures were similar to those of 1T-PdTe$_2$. These results suggest that CdI$_2$-type lattice symmetry dictates the band dispersion, regardless of atomic disorder in the chalcogen layers. As the electronic band dispersion and the local structures were persistent upon substitution, the enhancement of $T_C$ is likely associated with the chemical pressure. Our results provide insight into the effects of the solid solution on the surface and bulk electronic states as well as the superconducting transition temperature.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity in a two-component model with local electron pairs</title>

    <summary>  Superconductivity in the two component model of coexisting local electron pairs (hard-core charged bosons) and itinerant fermions coupled via charge exchange mechanism is discussed. The cases of isotropic s-wave and anisotropic pairing of extended s-wave and d_{x^2-y^2} symmetries are analyzed for a 2D square lattice within the BCS-mean field approximation and the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory. The phase diagrams and superconducting characteristics of this induced pairing model as a function of the position of the local pair (LP) level and the total carrier concentration are determined. The model exhibits several types of interesting crossovers between the BCS like behavior and that of LP's. In addition, the Uemura plots are obtained for extended s and d_{x^2-y^2} pairing symmetries. Finally, we analyze the pairing fluctuation effects (in 3D) within a generalized T-matrix approach. Some of our results are discussed in connection with a two-component scenario of preformed pairs and unpaired electrons for high temperature superconductors.</summary>
