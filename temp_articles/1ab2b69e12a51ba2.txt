    <summary>Hydrogen in metals has attracted much attention for a long time from both basic scientific and technological points of view. Its electronic state has been investigated in terms of a proton embedded in the electron gas mostly by the local density approximation (LDA) to the density functional theory. At high electronic densities, it is well described by a bare proton H^+ screened by metallic electrons (charge resonance), while at low densities two electrons are localized at the proton site to form a closed-shell negative ion H^- protected from surrounding metallic electrons by the Pauli exclusion principle. However, no details are known about the transition from H^+ to H^- in the intermediate-density region. Here, by accurately determining the ground-state electron distribution n(r) by the combination of LDA and diffusion Monte Carlo simulations with the total electron number up to 170, we obtain a complete picture of the transition, in particular, a sharp transition from short-range H^+ screening charge resonance to long-range Kondo-like spin-singlet resonance, the emergence of which is confirmed by the presence of an anomalous Friedel oscillation characteristic to the Kondo singlet state with the Kondo temperature T_K well beyond 1,000K. This study not only reveals interesting competition between charge and spin resonances, enriching the century-old paradigm of metallic screening to a point charge, but also discovers a long-sought novel high-T_K system, opening an unexpected route to room-temperature superconductivity in a Kondo lattice made of protons.</summary>

    <summary>A numerical and dimensional correlation supported by reported literature experimental evidence (Homes, Harshmann along with Voyager, EGRET, FERMI, WMAP, Planck and other space platforms) is presented which indicates that superconductivity is congruent with Charge Conjugation, Parity Change and TimeReversal (CPT) theorem and scalable with Friedmann Lemaire Robertson Walker (FLRW) cosmology within the concept of Schwinger pair production, Maxwell's permittivity-permeability and the de Broglie hypothesis. This momentum and energy conserving (elastic) CPT resonant structural lattice reverses phase and group velocities at the nuclear dimension as dictated by the speed of light and is scalable over 15 ours of magnitude from nuclear to universe dimensions, from the universe Big Bang event to present and is consistent with nuclear (quark) weak and strong forces, electromagnetic and gravitational forces being mediated by a particle of constant mass (110.123 x electron mass or 56.3 MeV/c2) related to the Higgs mass. This isotropic homogeneous CPT structure filling the space vacuum presently defines an extremely cold dark energy condition (&lt;&lt;CMBR) that dictates an equally extremely cold baryonic dark matter. The model predicts a deceleration value consistent with flat galactic rotation curves and with observed Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space translation and rotational deceleration and is generally consistent with the notion that: An object moving through momentum space will decelerate. This deceleration concept allows Type 1A supernovae universe expansion data to be interpreted as if the local universe is slowing down with respect to the rest. The predicted 33.8 microHz universe oscillations are observed by The LISA Pathfinder and stellar core gravity waves. The entire concept focuses towards engineering a critical optical volume energy (COVE) as a possible energy source.</summary>
