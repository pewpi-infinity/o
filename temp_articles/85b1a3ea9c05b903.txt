    <summary>  Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions formally admits an exact Chern-Simons wavefunction. It is an eigenfunction of the quantum Hamiltonian with zero energy. It is known to be unphysical for a variety of reasons, but it is still interesting to understand what it describes. We show that in expanding around this state, positive helicity gauge bosons have positive energy and negative helicity ones have negative energy. Some of the negative energy states would have negative norm. We also show that the Chern-Simons state is the supersymmetric partner of the naive fermion vacuum in which one does not fill the fermi sea. Finally, we give a sort of explanation of ``why'' this state exists. Similar properties can be expected for the analogous Kodama wavefunction of gravity.</summary>

    <summary>The distance conjecture claims that as the modulus traverses along the trans-Planckian geodesic distance, the effective field theory becomes invalid by a descent of a tower of states from UV. Moreover, according to the recent emergence proposal, the kinetic term of the modulus is entirely generated by the wavefunction renormalization in which a tower of states are integrated out. Assuming these two conjectures, we explore the role of a tower of states coupled to the modulus in (in)stability of the de Sitter (dS) vacuum by studying the one-loop effective potential generated by a tower of states. We find that a fermionic tower of states makes the effective potential more or less consistent with the dS swampland conjecture : either the slope or the curvature of the potential is sizeable. In contrast, the effective potential generated by a bosonic tower of states seems to allow the stable dS vacuum. Therefore, in order to argue the instability of the dS vacuum, the additional ingredient like supersymmetry breaking needs to be taken into account.</summary>

    <title>Vacuum polarization in high-dimensional AdS spacetime in the presence of a cosmic string and compactified extra dimension</title>

    <summary>In this paper, we analyze the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor associated with a charged and massive scalar quantum field in a generalized $(D+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space in the presence of a cosmic string, admitting a magnetic flux running along the string's core. In addition we admit that an extra coordinate is compactified to a circle and presents a magnetic flux running along its center. This compactification is implemented by imposing a quasiperiodic condition on the field with an arbitrary phase. The calculation of the VEVs of the field squared and the energy-moment tensor, are developed by using positive-energy Wightman function. The latter is construct by the mode sum over the complete set of normalized bosonic wavefunctions. Due to the compactification, the Wightman function is presented as the sum of two distinct contributions. The first one corresponding to the idealized cosmic string, and the second is induced by the compactification. The latter goes to zero for an infinite length of the compactification. As a consequence of the general structure of the Wightman function, both VEVs present also this decomposition. Moreover, due to the Aharanov-Bohm type of interaction between the field with the magnetic fluxes, the VEVs depend on the fractional part of the ration between the total flux and the quantum one.</summary>
