    <summary>We have systematically investigated the annealing effect on the superconductivity of iron chalcogenide Fe1+y(Te1-xSex). The atmospheres used for annealing include O2, N2, I2 vapor, air and vacuum. We observed that annealing in O2, I2 and air could enhance superconductivity for the underdoped samples, consistent with the results reported in literatures. Interestingly, we found that annealing in N2 also leads to superconductivity enhancement, similar to the annealing effects of O2, I2 and air. However, vacuum annealing does not enhance superconductivity, which indicates that the enhanced superconductivity in O2-, N2-, I2- and air-annealed samples is not due to improved homogeneity. In addition, we have treated the underdoped samples with nitric acid, which is found to enhance superconductivity as well. Our analyses of these results support the argument that the superconductivity enhancement, caused either by annealing or nitric acid treatment, originates from the variation of interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe, which is destructive to superconducting pairing, can be reduced by annealing in oxidation agents or nitric acid treatment. We also find that although N2-, O2- and air-annealed samples exhibit strong superconducting diamagnetism with -4pichi ~1 (chi, dc magnetic susceptibility) for some samples, their actual superconducting volume fraction probed by specific heat is low, ranging from 10% to 30% for 0.09 &lt; x &lt; 0.3, indicating that the superconductivity suppression remains significant even in annealed samples. The strong diamagnetism is associated with the superconducting shielding effect on the non-superconducting phase. We have also established the phase diagram of the annealed samples and compared it with that of the as-grown samples. The effect of annealing on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity is discussed.</summary>

    <title>In-situ Magnesium Diboride Superconducting Thin Films grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>

    <summary>  Superconducting thin films of MgB2 were deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition on magnesium oxide and sapphire substrates. Samples grown at 450C in an argon buffer pressure of about 10-2 mbar by using a magnesium enriched target resulted to be superconducting with a transition temperature of about 25 K. Film deposited from a MgB2 sintered pellet target in ultra high vacuum conditions showed poor metallic or weak semiconducting behavior and they became superconducting only after an ex-situ annealing in Mg vapor atmosphere. Up to now, no difference in the superconducting properties of the films obtained by these two procedures has been evidenced.</summary>

    <title>Influence of Mg Deficiency on the Superconductivity in MgB2 Thin Films Grown by using HPCVD</title>

    <summary>  The effects of Mg deficiency in MgB2 films grown by using hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition were investigated after vacuum annealing at various temperatures. High-quality MgB2 films grown on c-cut Al2O3 substrates with different superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 40.2 and 41 K were used in this study. As the annealing temperature was increased from 200 to 800 C, the Mg contents in the MgB2 films systemically decreased, but the Tc's did not change, within 0.12 K, until the annealing temperature reached 700 C. For MgB2 films annealed at 800 C for 30 min, however, no superconductivity was observed, and the temperature dependence of the resistivity showed a semiconducting behavior. We also found that the residual resistivity ratio decreased with increasing annealing temperature.</summary>
