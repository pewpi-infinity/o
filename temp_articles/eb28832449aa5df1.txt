    <summary>The one dimensional (1D) driven quantum coupled pseudoforce system governing the dynamics of collective Langmuir electron oscillations is used in order to investigate the effects of variety of space charge distributions on plasmon excitations of a nearly free electron gas with arbitrary degree of degeneracy and electron fluid temperature. A generalized closed form analytic expression for the grand wavefunction of collective excitations in presence of an arbitrary space charge distribution is presented based on the stationary solutions of the driven coupled pseudoforce system which has been derived from the Schrödinger-Poisson model. The wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles for some especial cases such as the Heaviside charge distribution, Dirac charge sheet, impurity charge sheet in 1D plasmonic lattice and the Kroning-Penney Dirac charge distributions with particular applications in plasmonics and condensed matter physics is investigated in this paper. It is remarkably found that two parallel Dirac charged sheets completely shield all interior plasmon excitations with any given energy value from outside electrostatic fields and charge densities. It is also found that the presence of even a weakly charged impurity layer within a perfect 1D plasmonic crystal profoundly destroys the periodic electrostatic field of the crystal lattice, hence, the Bloch character of the wavefunction considered in band gap theory of solids. Current investigation of electron excitations in arbitrary degenerate electron gas in the presence of static charge distributions may be used to develop analytic models for a variety of real physical situations. It also helps in further developments of the rapidly growing fields of nanotechnology and plasmonics.</summary>

    <summary>We present a fully second-quantized calculation showing the emergence of spontaneous coherent configurations of the electromagnetic field in interaction with charged bosons in a regular lattice. The bosons tend to oscillate at their plasma frequency, but are also subjected to electrostatic forces which keep them confined close to lattice sites and cause a frequency shift in the oscillation. Under certain conditions on these frequencies, we find that a suitably defined set of coherent states (coherent both in the field and matter degrees of freedom) exhibit a negative energy gap with respect to the perturbative ground state. This is true in the RWA approximation and for position-independent fields, both to first and second order in the interaction Hamiltonian. We compare this result with other recent findings from cavity QED and notice that: (1) consideration of full 3D wavefunctions and a careful definition of the coherent states are essential for obtaining the energy gap; (2) although our calculation is referred to bosons, it may also apply to protons bound in a crystal matrix, if their density is very low compared to the density of available states.</summary>

    <title>Pseudo-Resonance and Energy Band Gap in Plasmonic Crystals</title>

    <summary>In this paper, using the generalized coupled pseudoforce model with driving elements, we develop a method to study the plasmon excitations and energy band structure in a plasmonic crystal. It is shown that the presence of the periodic ion core potential leads to pseudo-resonance condition in the plasmon wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles, quite analogous to the frequency resonance, leading to the gap formation in the energy dispersion profiles. It is found that the dual length scale character of plasmon excitations lead to occurrence of a critical value of $a_c=2πλ_p$ for the lattice constant ($λ_p$ being the plasmon wavelength) above and below which the energy band structure of plasmonic crystals becomes substantially different. It is also found that energy band gap positions of parabolic free electron energy dispersion relation are slightly higher compared to that of the plasmon excitations. Here based on the plasmon definition and due to the dual length scale character of plasmons compared to that of single electrons, we provide a simplified interpretation of the wave-particle duality in quantum physics and provide the length scale regime in which both wave and particle properties can be simultaneously examined in a single experiment, where, the complementarity principle breaks down. However, the dual characteristics of electron-plasmon coupled excitations, quite analogous to starling murmuration phenomenon, strongly suggests that the long south de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave of electron is nothing but the plasmon itself. The wavefunction and electrostatic potential solution for a one dimensional plasmonic lattice with a generalized periodic potential is also derived in this research.</summary>
