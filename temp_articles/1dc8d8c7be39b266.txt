    <summary>The effect of annealing on the superconducting properties of niobium single crystals cut from the same master boule was studied by local and global magnetic measurements, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The formation of large hydride precipitates was observed in unannealed samples. The variation in structural and magnetic properties was studied after annealing under high vacuum at 800 C, 1400 C, and near the melting point of niobium (2477 C) for a few seconds. The initial samples had a high hydrogen content. Polarized optics and magneto-optical studies show that the formation of large niobium hydride precipitates is suppressed already by 800 C annealing. However, the overall superconducting properties in the annealed samples did not improve after annealing, and in fact, worsened. The superconducting transition temperature decreased, the upper critical field increased, and the pinning strength increased. Parallel studies were conducted using STM, where the sample was annealed initially at 400 C, measured, annealed again at 1700 C, and measured again. These studies revealed a ``dirty'' superconducting gap with a significant spatial variation of tunneling conductance after annealing at 400 C. The clean gap was recovered after annealing at 1700 C. It is likely that these results are due to oxygen redistribution near the surface, which is always covered by oxide layers in as-grown crystals. Overall, the results indicate that vacuum annealing at least up to 1400 C, while expected to remove a large amount of hydrogen, introduces additional nanosized defects, perhaps hydride precipitates, that act as efficient pair-breaking and pinning centers.</summary>

    <title>Laser-equipped gas reaction chamber for probing environmentally sensitive materials at near atomic scale</title>

    <summary>Numerous metallurgical and materials science applications depend on quantitative atomic-scale characterizations of environmentally-sensitive materials and their transient states. Studying the effect upon materials subjected to thermochemical treatments in specific gaseous atmospheres is of central importance for specifically studying a material's resistance to certain oxidative or hydrogen environments. It is also important for investigating catalytic materials, direct reduction of an oxide, particular surface science reactions or nanoparticle fabrication routes. This manuscript realizes such experiments upon a thermochemical reaction chamber called the Reacthub and allows for transferring treated materials under cryogenic &amp; ultrahigh vacuum workflow conditions for characterisation by either atom probe or scanning Xe+/electron microscopies. Two examples are discussed in the present study. One protocol was in the deuterium gas charging (25 kPa D2 at 200 °C) of a high-manganese twinning-induced-plasticity steel and characterization of the ingress and trapping of hydrogen at various features (grain boundaries in particular) in efforts to relate this to the steel's hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Deuterium was successfully detected after gas charging but most contrast originated from the complex ion FeOD+ signal and the feature may be an artefact. The second example considered the direct deuterium reduction (5 kPa D2 at 700 °C) of a single crystal wuestite sample, demonstrating that under a standard thermochemical treatment causes rapid reduction upon the nanoscale. Further studies are required for complete confidence about these phenomena, but these experiments successfully demonstrate that how an ex-situ thermochemical treatment can be realised that captures environmentally-sensitive transient states that can be analysed by atomic-scale by atom probe microscope.</summary>
