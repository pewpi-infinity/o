    <summary>  The $\cal PT$-symmetric complexified Scarf II potential  $V(x)= - V_1 \sech^{2}x + {\rm i} V_2 \sech x \tanh x$, $V_1&gt;0$ , $V_{2}\neq 0$ is revisited to study the interplay among its coupling parameters.  The existence of an isolated real and positive energy level that has been recently identified as a spectral singularity or zero-width resonance is here demonstrated through the behaviour of the corresponding wavefunctions and some property of the associated pseudo-norms is pointed out. We also construct four different rationally-extended supersymmetric partners to $V(x)$, which are $\cal PT$-symmetric or complex non-$\cal PT$-symmetric according to the coupling parameters range. A detailed study of one of these partners reveals that SUSY preserves the $V(x)$ spectral singularity existence.</summary>

    <title>Spectral properties of Dirac billiards at the van Hove singularities</title>

    <summary>We study distributions of the ratios of level spacings of a rectangular and an Africa-shaped superconducting microwave resonator containing circular scatterers on a triangular grid, so-called Dirac billiards (DBs). The high-precision measurements allowed the determination of all 1651 and 1823 eigenfrequencies in the first two bands, respectively. The resonance densities are similar to that of graphene. They exhibit two sharp peaks at the van Hove singularities, that separate the band structure into regions with a linear and a quadratic dispersion relation, respectively. In their vicinity we observe rapid changes, e.g., in the wavefunction structure. Accordingly, the question arose, whether there the spectral properties are still determined by the shapes of the DBs. The commonly used statistical measures, however, are no longer applicable whereas, as demonstrated in this Letter, the ratio distributions provide most suitable ones.</summary>

    <summary>The Hamilton operator of an open quantum system is non-Hermitian. Its eigenvalues are, generally, complex and provide not only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. The states may couple via the common environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded. This causes an {\it external mixing} (EM) of the states. Mathematically, EM is related to the existence of singular (the so-called exceptional) points (EPs). The eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure for the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum value. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an EP. At the parameter value of maximum width bifurcation, the phase rigidity approaches the value one, meaning that the two eigenfunctions become orthogonal. However, the eigenfunctions are externally mixed at this parameter value. The S-matrix and therewith the cross section do contain, in the one-channel case, almost no information on the EM of the states. The situation is completely different in the case with two (or more) channels where the resonance structure is strongly influenced by the EM of the states and interesting features of non-Hermitian quantum physics are revealed. We provide numerical results for two and three nearby eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator which are embedded in one common continuum and influenced by two adjoining EPs. The results are discussed. They are of interest for an experimental test of the non-Hermitian quantum physics as well as for applications.</summary>

    <arxiv:comment>Title of the paper is changed. The Introduction is broaden. The difference of the non-Hermitian formalism for the description of open quantum systems in our paper to the description of PT-symmetric systems is underlined.
