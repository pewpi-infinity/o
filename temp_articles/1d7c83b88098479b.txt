    <summary>We present a neural flow wavefunction, Gauge-Fermion FlowNet, and use it to simulate 2+1D lattice compact quantum electrodynamics with finite density dynamical fermions. The gauge field is represented by a neural network which parameterizes a discretized flow-based transformation of the amplitude while the fermionic sign structure is represented by a neural net backflow. This approach directly represents the $U(1)$ degree of freedom without any truncation, obeys Guass's law by construction, samples autoregressively avoiding any equilibration time, and variationally simulates Gauge-Fermion systems with sign problems accurately. In this model, we investigate confinement and string breaking phenomena in different fermion density and hopping regimes. We study the phase transition from the charge crystal phase to the vacuum phase at zero density, and observe the phase seperation and the net charge penetration blocking effect under magnetic interaction at finite density. In addition, we investigate a magnetic phase transition due to the competition effect between the kinetic energy of fermions and the magnetic energy of the gauge field. With our method, we further note potential differences on the order of the phase transitions between a continuous $U(1)$ system and one with finite truncation. Our state-of-the-art neural network approach opens up new possibilities to study different gauge theories coupled to dynamical matter in higher dimensions.</summary>

    <summary>We perform a computational study of confined photonic states that appear in a three-dimensional (3D) superlattice of coupled cavities, resulting from a superstructure of intentional defects. The states are isolated from the vacuum by a 3D photonic band gap, using a diamond-like inverse woodpile crystal structure, and exhibit 'Cartesian' hopping of photons in high-symmetry directions. We investigate the confinement dimensionality to verify which states are fully 3D confined, using a recently developed scaling theory to analyze the influence of the structural parameters of the 3D crystal. We create confinement maps that trace the frequencies of 3D confined bands for select combinations of key structural parameters, namely the pore radii of the underlying regular crystal and of the defect pores. We find that a certain minimum difference between the regular and defect pore radii is necessary for 3D confined bands to appear, and that an increasing difference between the defect pore radii from the regular radii supports more 3D confined bands. In our analysis we find that their symmetries and spatial distributions are more varied than electronic orbitals known from solid state physics. We also discover pairs of degenerate 3D confined bands with p-like orbital shapes and mirror symmetries matching the symmetry of the superlattice. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of the local density of optical states (LDOS) for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) applications. We find that donor-like superlattices, i.e., where the defect pores are smaller than the regular pores, provide greater enhancement in the air region than acceptor-like structures with larger defect pores, and thus offer better prospects for doping with quantum dots and ultimately for 3D networks of single photons steered across strongly-coupled cavities.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Band Structure and Topology in One Dimensional Modulated Plasmonic Crystal</title>

    <summary>Band structures of electrons in a periodic potential are well-known to host topologies that impact their behaviors at edges and interfaces. The concept however is more general than the single-electron setting. In this work, we consider topology of plasmons in a two-dimensional metal, subject to a unidirectional periodicity. We show how the plasmon modes and wavefunctions may be computed for such a periodic system, by focusing on the confined, quantized photon degrees of freedom associated with the plasmon modes. At low frequencies the plasmons disperse with wavevector as $\sqrt{q}$; however at higher frequencies one finds a series of bands and gaps in the spectrum. For a unidirectional periodic electron density with inversion symmetry, we show that each band hosts a Zak phase $γ_n$ which may only take the values $0$ or $π$. Each gap has a topological index $ν$ that is determined by the sum of the Zak phases below it. When the system has an interface with the vacuum, one finds in-gap modes for gaps with non-trivial topologies, which are confined to the interface. In addition, interfaces between systems that are the same except for their topologies -- which can be created by a defect in the lattice in which half a unit cell has been removed -- host in-gap, confined states when the topological indices of the relevant gaps are different. We demonstrate these properties numerically by analyzing a Kronig-Penney-type model in graphene, in which the electron density is piecewise constant, modulating between two different densities. In addition, we consider a related plasmon system modeled after the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We show that the topological phase diagram of the lowest energy bands is highly analogous to that of the SSH tight-binding system.</summary>
