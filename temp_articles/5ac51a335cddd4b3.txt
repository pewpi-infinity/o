    <summary>  The equilibrium of a finite-beta cylindrical RFP plasma in the presence of saturated-amplitude tearing modes is investigated. The singularities arising from the perturbative analysis of the MHD force balance equation JxB=grad(p) are resolved through a proper regularization of the cylindrical symmetric component of the pressure and parallel current density profiles, by setting to zero their gradient at the modes rational surfaces. An equilibrium model, which satisfies the regularization rule at the various rational surfaces, is developed. The comparison with the experimental data from the Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX) gives encouraging results. The model provides an easy tool to extrapolate the magnetic data, ordinarily measured only at the plasma edge, inside the plasma. As an application, we present the computation of the particle and heat stochastic diffusion coefficient from the reconstructed magnetic field profile.</summary>

    <title>Steady plasma flows in a periodic non-symmetric domain</title>

    <summary>Steady plasma flows have been studied almost exclusively in systems with continuous symmetry or in open domains. In the absence of continuous symmetry, the lack of a conserved quantity makes the study of flows intrinsically challenging. In a toroidal domain, the requirement of double-periodicity for physical quantities adds to the complications. In particular, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of plasma steady-state with the flow in a non-symmetric toroidal domain allows the development of singularities when the rotational transform of the magnetic field is rational, much like the equilibrium MHD model. In this work, we show that steady flows can still be maintained provided the rotational transform is close to rational and the magnetic shear is weak. We extend the techniques developed in carrying out perturbation methods to all orders for static MHD equilibrium by Weitzner (Physics of Plasmas 21, 022515 (2014)) to MHD equilibrium with flows. We construct perturbative MHD equilibrium in a doubly-periodic domain with nearly parallel flows by systematically eliminating magnetic resonances order by order. We then utilize an additional symmetry of the flow problem, first discussed by E. Hameiri in (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{22}, 2080 (1981) Sec. III), to obtain a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for a class of non-symmetric three-dimensional MHD equilibrium with flows both parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. For this class of flows, we are able to obtain non-symmetric generalizations of integrals of motion, such as Bernoulli's function and angular momentum. Finally, we obtain the generalized Hamada conditions, which are consistency conditions necessary to suppress singular currents in such a system when the magnetic field lines are closed. We do not attempt to address the question of neoclassical damping of flows.</summary>

    <title>Power coupled to the slow wave resonance cone in cold plasma</title>

    <summary>We consider the power coupled to the plasma from a cylindrical source emitting resonance cones, propagative slow waves which exist in low density magnetized plasmas when the signs of the Stix parameters S and P differ. In this work, we calculate this power for the first time for any collisionality, and show that it remains finite in the cold collisionless limit, even as the radiofrequency electric field itself, and the associated power absorption density, is singular. We give the main parameter dependencies of the coupled power.</summary>
