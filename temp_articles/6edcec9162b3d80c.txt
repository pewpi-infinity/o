    <summary>The second and third order nonlinear susceptibilities of the ferroelectric oxides LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$, and KNbO$_3$ are calculated from first principles. Two distinct methodologies are compared, one approach is based on a perturbative approach within the frequency-domain, another on the time-evolution of the electric polarization. The frequency dependence of the second harmonic coefficients of the ferroelectric phase of LiNbO$_3$ calculated within the two approaches is in excellent agreement. This is further validated by experimental data for LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, measured for an incident range of photon energies between 0.78 eV and 1.6 eV. The real-time based approach is furthermore employed to estimate the third order nonlinear susceptibilities of all investigated ferroelectric oxides. We further show that the quasiparticle effects, considered by means of a scissors-shift in combination with the the computationally efficient independent particle approximation, result in a shift all spectral features towards higher energies and decrease the magnitude of the optical nonlinearities. The energy of the main resonances in the hyperpolarizabilities suggests that the spectra can be understood by multi-photon adsorption within the fundamental bandgap for all investigated materials.</summary>

    <summary>$β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a semiconductor with bandgap in the deep-UV ~ 5 eV. Due to its strong phonon-hole coupling, holes are self-trapped inhibiting bandgap luminescence at the deep-UV. In contrast, the self-trapped holes (STH) can exhibit a strong luminescence at ~ 3.5 eV. This research addresses the thermal response of the STH photoluminescence (PL), and the role of phonon interactions at temperatures 77 K - 622 K in nanocrystalline films. It was found that the PL intensity strongly diminishes as a function of increasing temperature with activation energy ~ 72 meV. A study of the Raman modes revealed that the intensity of the high frequency modes of the Ga$_I$O$_4$ site decrease with temperature, implying a phonon annihilation process. These modes, which have comparable energy to the STH activation energy, thus can couple to the STH and transition them from a radiative to a non-radiative regime in accordance with the configurational coordinate model at the strong phonon coupling limit. The significantly broad Gaussian linewidth of the PL is also a manifestation of a strong STH-phonon coupling. Furthermore, the peak position of the STH exhibited a negligible temperature response, in contrast to the redshift of ~ 220 meV of the bandedge of the film. In contrast to the intensity behavior of the high frequency Raman modes, the low frequency ones were found to follow the thermal Bose-Einstein phonon population.</summary>

    <title>Optomechanical ring resonator for efficient microwave-optical frequency conversion</title>

    <summary>Phonons traveling in solid-state devices are emerging as a universal excitation that can couple to different physical systems through mechanical interaction. At microwave frequencies and in solid-state materials, phonons have a similar wavelength to optical photons, enabling them to interact efficiently with light and produce strong optomechanical effects that are highly desirable for classical and quantum signal transduction between optical and microwave. It becomes conceivable to build optomechanical integrated circuits (OMIC) that guide both photons and phonons and interconnect discrete photonic and phononic devices. Here, we demonstrate an OMIC including an optomechanical ring resonator (OMR), in which infrared photons and GHz phonons co-resonate to induce significantly enhanced interconversion. The OMIC is built on a hybrid platform where wide bandgap semiconductor gallium phosphide (GaP) is used as the waveguiding material and piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) is used for phonon generation. The OMR features photonic and phononic quality factors of $&gt;1\times10^5$ and $3.2\times10^3$, respectively, and resonantly enhances the optomechanical conversion between photonic modes to achieve an internal conversion efficiency $η_i=(2.1\pm0.1)%$ and a total device efficiency $η_{tot}=0.57\times10^{-6}$ at a low acoustic pump power of 1.6 mW. The efficient conversion in OMICs enables microwave-optical transduction for many applications in quantum information processing and microwave photonics.</summary>
