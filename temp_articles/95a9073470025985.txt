    <summary>  We apply a wilsonian renormalization group approach to the system of electrons in a two-dimensional square lattice interacting near the saddle-points of the band, when the correlations at momentum ${\bf Q} = (π, π)$ prevail in the system. The detailed consideration of the spin degrees of freedom allows to discern the way in which the SU(2) spin invariance is preserved in the renormalization process. Regarding the spin correlations, we find two different universality classes which correspond, in the context of the extended Hubbard model, to having the bare on-site interaction $U$ repulsive or attractive. The first class is characterized by a spin instability which develops through the condensation of particle-hole pairs with momentum ${\bf Q}$, with the disappearance of the Fermi line in the neighborhood of the saddle-points. Within that class, the attractive or repulsive character of the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ dictates whether there is or not a d-wave superconducting instability in the system. For the Hubbard model with just on-site interaction, we show that some of the irrelevant operators are able to trigger the superconducting instability. The naturalness of the competing instabilities is guaranteed by the existence of a range of doping levels in which the chemical potential of the open system is renormalized to the level of the saddle-points. We incorporate this effect to obtain the phase diagram as a function of the bare chemical potential, which displays a point of optimal doping separating the regions of superconductivity and spin instability.</summary>

    <title>Valley polarization, magnetization, and superconductivity in bilayer graphene near the van Hove singularity</title>

    <summary>The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</summary>

    <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

    <summary>We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</summary>
