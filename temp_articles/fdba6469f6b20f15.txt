    <summary>This paper describes the CERN's vacuum control system from the field devices to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition software. First, a particular attention is given to the environment present in the accelerators, like noise coupling and ionizing radiation, which can affect the quality of the measurements and the reliability of the system. Then, the main vacuum instruments and their associated conditioning circuits and controllers are presented, before to introduce the hardware interlock logic and alarms used for the vacuum system and the machine protection. Finally, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition software and its architecture are described, including data engineering and the main functionalities provided to the users for controls and diagnostics.</summary>

    <summary>Metal vapour vacuum arcs are capable to generate multiply charged metallic ions, which are widely used in fields such as ion deposition, ion thrusters, and ion sources, etc. According to the stationary model of cathode spot, those ions are generated by electron-impact single ionization in a step-wise manner, which is M -&gt; M+ -&gt; M2+ -&gt; ... mainly. This paper is designed to study quantitatively the role of double ionization M -&gt; M2+ in the breakdown initiation of copper vacuum arcs. A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) scheme of double ionization is proposed and incorporated into a 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) method. The super-particles of Cu2+ ions generated from different channels are labelled independently in the PIC-DSMC modelling of vacuum arc breakdown. The cathode erosion rate based on PIC modelling is about 40μg/C in arc burning regime, which agrees well with previous experiments. The temporal discharge behaviours such as arc current, arc voltage, and ionization degree of arc plasma, are influenced with or without double ionization negligibly. However, additional Cu2+ ions are generated near the cathode in breakdown initiation from the double ionization channel, with a lower kinetic energy on average. Therefore, the results on spatial distribution and energy spectra of Cu2+ ions are different with or without double ionization. This paper provides a quantitative research method to evaluate the role of multiply ionization in vacuum arcs.</summary>

    <title>Models of magnetized neutron star atmospheres: thin atmospheres and partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres with vacuum polarization</title>

    <summary>  Observed X-ray spectra of some isolated magnetized neutron stars display absorption features, sometimes interpreted as ion cyclotron lines. Modeling the observed spectra is necessary to check this hypothesis and to evaluate neutron star parameters.We develop a computer code for modeling magnetized neutron star atmospheres in a wide range of magnetic fields (10^{12} - 10^{15} G) and effective temperatures (3 \times 10^5 - 10^7 K). Using this code, we study the possibilities to explain the soft X-ray spectra of isolated neutron stars by different atmosphere models. The atmosphere is assumed to consist either of fully ionized electron-ion plasmas or of partially ionized hydrogen. Vacuum resonance and partial mode conversion are taken into account. Any inclination of the magnetic field relative to the stellar surface is allowed. We use modern opacities of fully or partially ionized plasmas in strong magnetic fields and solve the coupled radiative transfer equations for the normal electromagnetic modes in the plasma. Spectra of outgoing radiation are calculated for various atmosphere models: fully ionized semi-infinite atmosphere, thin atmosphere, partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere, or novel "sandwich" atmosphere (thin atmosphere with a hydrogen layer above a helium layer. Possibilities of applications of these results are discussed. In particular, the outgoing spectrum using the "sandwich" model is constructed. Thin partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres with vacuum polarization are shown to be able to improve the fit to the observed spectrum of the nearby isolated neutron star RBS 1223 (RX J1308.8+2127).</summary>
