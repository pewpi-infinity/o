    <summary>Using the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) we investigate the variation in the 1s energy levels of hydrogen and helium-like static ions in fully degenerate electron gas. The semiclassical Thomas-Fermi (TF), Shukla-Eliasson (SE) and corrected Shukla-Eliasson (cSE) models are compared. It is remarked that these models merge into the vacuum level for hydrogen and helium-like ions in the dilute classical electron gas regime. While in the TF model hydrogen ground state level lifts monotonically towards the continuum limit with increase in the electron concentration, in the SE and cSE models universal bound stabilization valley through the energy minimization occurs at a particular electron concentration range for the hydrogen-like ion which for cSE model closely matches the electron concentrations in typical metals. The later stabilizing mechanism appears to be due to the interaction between plasmon excitations and the Fermi lengthscales in metallic density regime. In the case of helium-like ions, however, no such stability mechanism is found. The application of cSE model with electron exchange and correlation effects reveals that cSE model qualitatively accounts for the number-density and lattice parameters of elemental metals within the framework of free electron assumption. According to the cSE model of static charge screening a simple metal-insulator transition criterion is defined. Current investigation may further elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms in the formation and dielectric properties of metallic compounds.</summary>

    <title>Depletion of nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond via hydrogen passivation</title>

    <summary>We show a marked reduction in the emission from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in single crystal diamond due to exposure of the diamond to hydrogen plasmas ranging from 700°C to 1000°C. Significant fluorescence reduction was observed beneath the exposed surface to at least 80mm depth after ~10 minutes, and did not recover after post-annealing in vacuum for seven hours at 1100°C. We attribute the fluorescence reduction to the formation of NVH centers by the plasma induced diffusion of hydrogen. These results have important implications for the formation of nitrogen-vacancy centers for quantum applications, and inform our understanding of the conversion of nitrogen-vacancy to NVH, whilst also providing the first experimental evidence of long range hydrogen diffusion through intrinsic high-purity diamond material.</summary>

    <title>Holography and two phases of the QCD vacuum</title>

    <summary>  The holographic principle is often (and hastily) attributed to quantum gravity and domains of the Planck size. Meanwhile it can be usefully applied to problems where gravitation effects are negligible and domains of less exotic size. The essence of this principle is that any physical system can be taken to be either classical, placed in a D+1-dimensional spacetime, or quantum-mechanical, located in its D-dimensional boundary. For example, one believes that a hydrogen atom is a typical quantum system living in a four-dimensional spacetime, but it can also be conceived as a classical system living in a five-dimensional embracing spacetime. The subnuclear realm is more intricate since the gluon vacuum reveals two phases, the hadronic and plasma phases. They differ in energetics and symmetry. Moreover, the classical four-dimensional picture is pertinent to the behavior of constituent quarks while the plasma phase is expected to be grasped by standard four-dimensional QCD. The relation between the holographic standpoint and the symmetry treatment of these two phases is outlined. Exact retarded solutions to the classical SU(N) four-dimensional Yang-Mills equations with the source composed of several point-like colored particles is considered. Features of these solutions in the large-N limit provide insight into the gauge symmetries of two gluon vacua.</summary>
