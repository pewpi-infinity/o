    <summary>A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 Å to 8.082 Å, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen-doped cubic diamond and the crystal structure of n-diamond</title>

    <summary>To understand the crystal structure of n-diamond, a hydrogen-doped (H-doped) diamond model has been investigated using first principles calculations. In particular, hydrogen concentration dependent elastic constants and lattice parameters for the H-doped diamond have been analyzed. Our results indicate that when the hydrogen concentration is less than 19 at.%, the H-doped diamond is mechanically stable. When the hydrogen concentration is about 4 at.%, the optimized lattice parameter, simulated XRD pattern and electronic properties for the H-doped diamond all agree well with the corresponding experimental values of n-diamond. The results imply that the n-diamond is likely to be an H-doped diamond.</summary>

    <title>Ultrasonic investigation of the interaction hydrogen-dislocations in copper crystals</title>

    <summary>In this paper we present experimental data of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation obtained in a high purity crystalline sample of cooper hydrogenated by gaseous charge. The sample is oriented in the &lt;111&gt; crystallographic direction and aged for this work in three stages between 64 and 97 days. The results indicate that the hydrogen is mainly segregated at the dislocation core, inhibiting the Hydrogen Snoek-Köster relaxations verified at earlier aging stages. Despite of this, a contribution to viscosity in the kink-chain resonance is provided by the mobile hydrogen in the dislocations core by its side movement along the dislocation line. At temperatures at which the hydrogen begins to freeze in the lattice the geometrical kinks find a gradual increase on the hindering of their movements along dislocation lines, becoming immobile when the hydrogen is completely frozen in the crystal, anchoring the dislocations in short loops. Although the viscosity associated with the mobile hydrogen is removed, the resonance associated with geometrical kinks is not completely cancelled. The interaction hydrogen-dislocation can be fully described in terms of kinks in dislocations.</summary>
