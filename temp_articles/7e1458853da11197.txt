    <summary>Heavy vector mesons produced in a heavy ion collision are important sources of information about the quark gluon plasma (QGP). For instance, the fraction of bottomonium states observed in such a collision is altered by the dissociation effect caused by the plasma. So, it is very important to understand how the properties of the plasma, like temperature $(T)$, density and the presence of background magnetic fields $(eB)$, affect the dissociation of bottomonium in the thermal medium. AdS/QCD holographic models provide a tool for investigating the properties of heavy mesons inside a thermal medium. The meson states are represented by quasinormal modes in a black hole geometry. In this work we calculate the quasinormal modes and the associated complex frequencies for the four lowest levels of radial excitation of bottomonium inside a plasma with a magnetic field background. We also calculate the differential configuration entropy (DCE) for all these states and investigate how the dissociation effect produced by the magnetic field is translated into a dependence of the DCE on $eB$. An interesting result obtained in this study is that the DCE increases with the radial excitation level $n$. Also, a nontrivial finding of this work is that the energy density associated with the bottomonium quasinormal modes presents a singularity near the black hole horizon for some combination of values of $T, eB$ and $n$. As we show here, it is possible to separate the singular factor and define a square integrable quantity that provides a DCE that is always finite. In addition, we discovered that, working with the potentially singular energy density, one finds a very interesting way to use the DCE as a tool for determining the dissociation temperature of the meson quasisates.</summary>

    <title>Frequency Domain Singular Value Decomposition for Efficient Spatial Audio Coding</title>

    <summary>Advances in virtual reality have generated substantial interest in accurately reproducing and storing spatial audio in the higher order ambisonics (HOA) representation, given its rendering flexibility. Recent standardization for HOA compression adopted a framework wherein HOA data are decomposed into principal components that are then encoded by standard audio coding, i.e., frequency domain quantization and entropy coding to exploit psychoacoustic redundancy. A noted shortcoming of this approach is the occasional mismatch in principal components across blocks, and the resulting suboptimal transitions in the data fed to the audio coder. Instead, we propose a framework where singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed after transformation to the frequency domain via the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). This framework not only ensures smooth transition across blocks, but also enables frequency dependent SVD for better energy compaction. Moreover, we introduce a novel noise substitution technique to compensate for suppressed ambient energy in discarded higher order ambisonics channels, which significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the reconstructed HOA signal. Objective and subjective evaluation results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of both higher compression gains and better perceptual quality, compared to existing methods.</summary>

    <title>High frequency quasi-normal modes for black holes with generic singularities II: Asymptotically non-flat spacetimes</title>

    <summary>  The possibility that the asymptotic quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies can be used to obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole -- commonly referred to as Hod's conjecture -- has received considerable attention. To test this conjecture, using monodromy technique, attempts have been made to analytically compute the asymptotic frequencies for a large class of black hole spacetimes. In an earlier work, two of the current authors computed the high frequency QNMs for scalar perturbations of $(D+2)$ dimensional spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, single horizon spacetimes with generic power-law singularities. In this work, we extend these results to asymptotically non-flat spacetimes. Unlike the earlier analyses, we treat asymptotically flat and de Sitter spacetimes in a unified manner, while the asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetimes is considered separately. We obtain master equations for the asymptotic QNM frequency for all the three cases. We show that for all the three cases, the real part of the asymptotic QNM frequency -- in general -- is not proportional to ln(3) thus indicating that the Hod's conjecture may be restrictive.</summary>
