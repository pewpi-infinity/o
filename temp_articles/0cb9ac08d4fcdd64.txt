    <summary>Running quantum algorithms on real hardware is essential for understanding their strengths and limitations, especially in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Herein we focus on the practical aspect of quantum computational calculations of solid-state crystalline materials based on theory developed in our group by using real quantum hardware with a novel noise mitigation technique referred to as partition-measurement symmetry verification, which performs post-selection of shot counts based on $Z_{2}$ and $U_{1}$ symmetry verification. We select two periodic systems with different level of complexity for these calculations. One of them is the distorted hydrogen chain as an example of very simple systems, and the other one is iron crystal in the BCC and FCC phases as it is considered to be inaccessible by using classical computational wavefunction methods. The ground state energies are evaluated based on the translational quantum subspace expansion (TransQSE) method for the hydrogen chain, and periodic boundary condition adapted VQE for our iron models. By applying these techniques for the simplest 2 qubit iron model systems, the correlation energies obtained by the hardware calculations agree with those of the state-vector simulations within $\sim$5 kJ/mol. Although the quantum computational resources used for those experiments are still limited, the techniques applied to obtain our simplified models will be applicable in essentially the same manner to more complicated cases as quantum hardware matures.</summary>

    <title>Backflow Correlations for the Electron Gas and Metallic Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>  We justify and evaluate backflow-threebody wavefunctions for a two component system of electrons and protons. Based on the generalized Feynman-Kacs formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band structure calculations, we analyze the use and the analytical form of the backflow function from different points of view. The resulting wavefunctions are used in Variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-threebody wavefunctions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using LDA orbitals in the trial wavefunction. However, compared to wavefunctions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wavefunctions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.</summary>

    <summary>Experimental data and the principles of quantum mechanics suggest that a crystal is a condensate of `wavicles' enclosed in a box, where `wavicle' denotes the indefinite wave-particle status of the microscopic constituents. When it is not perturbed the crystal is in a classical-like state. The wavefunction, the internal energy and the entropy are all of them equal to zero. The thermodynamic temperature is indefinite. Perturbations via energy- and/or momentum-transfer reveal quantum effects. The temperature laws for the heat capacities of some hydrogen-bonded crystals are rationalized with superposition states depending on the quantum temperature which is crystal-dependent. Heat-transfer is a coherent anentropic process. Apart from energy conservation, the other laws of thermodynamics are irrelevant.</summary>
