    <summary>A relativistic quantum field theory with nontrivial background fields is developed and applied to study waves in plasmas. The effective action of the electromagnetic 4-potential is calculated ab initio from the standard action of scalar QED using path integrals. The resultant effective action is gauge invariant and contains nonlocal interactions, from which gauge bosons acquire masses without breaking the local gauge symmetry. To demonstrate how the general theory can be applied, we study a cold unmagnetized plasma and a cold uniformly magnetized plasma. Using these two examples, we show that all linear waves well-known in classical plasma physics can be recovered from relativistic quantum results when taking the classical limit. In the opposite limit, classical wave dispersion relations are modified substantially. In unmagnetized plasmas, longitudinal waves propagate with nonzero group velocities even when plasmas are cold. In magnetized plasmas, anharmonically spaced Bernstein waves persist even when plasmas are cold. These waves account for cyclotron absorption features observed in spectra of X-ray pulsars. Moreover, cutoff frequencies of the two non-degenerate electromagnetic waves are redshifted by different amounts. These corrections need to be taken into account in order to correctly interpret diagnostic results in laser plasma experiments.</summary>

    <summary>We present a fully second-quantized calculation showing the emergence of spontaneous coherent configurations of the electromagnetic field in interaction with charged bosons in a regular lattice. The bosons tend to oscillate at their plasma frequency, but are also subjected to electrostatic forces which keep them confined close to lattice sites and cause a frequency shift in the oscillation. Under certain conditions on these frequencies, we find that a suitably defined set of coherent states (coherent both in the field and matter degrees of freedom) exhibit a negative energy gap with respect to the perturbative ground state. This is true in the RWA approximation and for position-independent fields, both to first and second order in the interaction Hamiltonian. We compare this result with other recent findings from cavity QED and notice that: (1) consideration of full 3D wavefunctions and a careful definition of the coherent states are essential for obtaining the energy gap; (2) although our calculation is referred to bosons, it may also apply to protons bound in a crystal matrix, if their density is very low compared to the density of available states.</summary>

    <title>Gravitational waves and Higgs boson couplings for exploring first order phase transition in the model with a singlet scalar field</title>

    <summary>We calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves originated from strongly first order electroweak phase transition in the extended Higgs model with a real singlet field. In order to calculate the bubble nucleation rate, we perform a two-field analysis to evaluate bounce solutions connecting the true and the false vacua using the one-loop effective potential at finite temperatures. Imposing the Sakharov condition of the departure from thermal equilibrium for baryogenesis, we survey allowed regions of parameters of the model. We then investigate the gravitational waves produced at electroweak bubble collisions in the early Universe, such as the sound wave, the bubble wall collision and the plasma turbulence. We find that the strength at the peak frequency can be large enough to be detected at future space-based gravitational interferometers such as eLISA, DECIGO and BBO. Predicted deviations in the various Higgs boson couplings are also evaluated at the zero temperature, and are shown to be large enough too. Therefore, in this model strongly first order electroweak phase transition can be tested by the combination of the precision study of various Higgs boson couplings at LHC, the measurement of the triple Higgs boson coupling at future lepton colliders and the shape of the spectrum of gravitational wave detectable at future gravitational interferometers.</summary>
