    <summary>We first show a possible mechanism to create a new type of nuclear fusion, thermal resonance fusion, i.e. low energy nuclear fusion with thermal resonance of light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium or tritium. The fusion of two light nuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up to the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be realized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light atoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal resonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of the deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion mechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how these light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of metal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal vibrations and resonances at different modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect at different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates the thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect, is possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very sharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for thermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or make the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable compound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the penetrating probability larger than 10^{-10}.</summary>

    <summary>This work explores a novel approach to mitigating turbulence in fusion plasmas through spatially modulated plasma profiles. By imposing a harmonic modulation on plasma parameters, we introduce conditions that alter the propagation characteristics of turbulent and MHD waves, a primary source of transport and instabilities in fusion devices. This modulation approach resembles bandgap formation in solid-state and photonic crystals, where spatial periodicity suppresses wave propagation within specific frequency bands. The mathematical framework developed here essentially resembles the parametric resonance of the harmonic oscillator. It reveals how a controlled spatial variation of turbulent wave phase velocity can effectively attenuate turbulence and instabilities. Several methods for implementing this modulation in plasma, including RF waves, static magnetic field perturbations, and modulated density profiles, are proposed as potential paths for achieving stable confinement. This concept could provide a versatile and potentially more controllable alternative to existing turbulence suppression techniques, with the goal of improving stability and confinement across a variety of magnetized fusion configurations.</summary>

    <title>Observation of Thermal Deuteron-Deuteron Fusion in Ion Tracks</title>

    <summary>A direct observation of the deuteron-deuteron (DD) fusion reaction at thermal meV energies, although theoretically possible, is not succeeded up to now. The electron screening effect that reduces the repulsive Coulomb barrier between reacting nuclei in metallic environments by several hundreds of eV and is additionally increased by crystal lattice defects in the hosting material, leads to strongly enhanced cross sections which means that this effect might be studied in laboratories. Here we present results of the 2H(d,p)3H reaction measurements performed on a ZrD2 target down to the lowest deuteron energy in the center mass system of 675 eV, using an ultra-high vacuum accelerator system, recently upgraded to achieve high beam currents at very low energies. The experimental thick target yield, decreasing over seven orders of magnitude for lowering beam energies, could be well described by the electron screening energy of 340 eV, which is much higher than the value of about 100 eV for a defect free material. At the energies below 2.5 keV, a constant plateau yield value could be observed. As indicated by significantly increased energies of emitted protons, this effect can be associated with the thermal DD fusion. A theoretical model explains the experimental observations by creation of ion tracks induced in the target by projectiles, and a high phonon density which locally increases temperature above the melting point. The nuclear reaction rate taking into account recently observed DD threshold resonance agrees very well with the experimental data.</summary>
