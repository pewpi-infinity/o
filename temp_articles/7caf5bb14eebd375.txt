    <summary>  A QED-based mechanism, breaking translational invariance of the vacuum at sufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for the vacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtual vacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fields corresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_μ^{ext} (x)$, which is itself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_μ(x)$ in the presence of that $A_μ^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equation for $A_μ^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solution corresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; this solution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on the order of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble is included; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_μ$, whose magnitude is determined by a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observed acceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which the fields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysis suggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (corresponding to a "spontaneous vacuum phase change") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a "polarization of the QED vacuum" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum). Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing the possibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whose back-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. The possibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentum transfers is discussed.</summary>

    <title>Special relativity with an arbitrary invariant limiting velocity of a particle</title>

    <summary>It is shown that a generalized special theory of relativity (GSTR) with an arbitrary limiting velocity of a particle different or equal to the speed of light in vacuum can be constructed from the canonical equation of the 4-dimensional hyperboloid of revolution. In particular, when the limiting velocity equals the speed of light, the special theory of relativity (STR), which corresponds to the equation of the equilateral hyperboloid of revolution, is recovered. The generalized Lorentz transformations for any values of the speed limit for both the time-like and the spice-like regions in the coordinate and momentum spaces and in the general parametric form were obtained. It was established that the inversion of time (energy) axis under the (generalized) Lorentz transformations is forbidden. In the GSTR, the rest mass of a space-like particle is real. Our results strongly suggest that the muon neutrino in the OPERA experiment might most likely be a time-like or a light-like superluminal particle, whose limiting velocity may exceed the speed of light in vacuum, rather than a superluminal space-like particle (tachyon) with a speed limit equal to speed of light for which the rest mass $m=117.1^{+11.0}_{-10.5}$ MeV$/c^{2}$.</summary>

    <title>Strictly Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking</title>

    <summary>We consider an MSSM extension with anomaly mediation as the source of supersymmetry-breaking, and a U(1) symmetry which solves the tachyonic slepton problem, and introduces both the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses, and the Higgs mu-term. We compare its spectra with those from so-called minimal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. We find a Standard Model-like Higgs of mass 125 GeV with a gravitino mass of 140 TeV and tan(beta)=16. However, the muon anomalous magnetic moment is 3 sigma away from the experimental value.
  The model naturally produces a period of hybrid inflation, which can exit to a false vacuum characterised by large Higgs vevs, reaching the true ground state after a period of thermal inflation. The scalar spectral index is reduced to approximately 0.975, and the correct abundance of neutralino dark matter can be produced by decays of thermally-produced gravitinos, provided the gravitino mass (and hence the Higgs mass) is high. Naturally light cosmic strings are produced, satisfying bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The complementary pulsar timing and cosmic ray bounds require that strings decay primarily via loops into gravitational waves. Unless the loops are extremely small, the next generation pulsar timing array will rule out or detect the string-derived gravitational radiation background in this model.</summary>
