    <summary>Quantum light sources are crucial foundational components for various quantum technology applications. With the rapid development of quantum technology, there has been a growing demand for materials with the capability of hosting quantum emitters. One such material platform uses fluorescent defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that can host deep sublevels within the bandgap. The localized electron irradiation has shown its effectiveness in generating deep sublevels to induce single emitters in hBN. The question is whether localized (electron beam) irradiation is a reliable tool for creating emitters in other wide bandgap materials and its uniqueness to hBN. Here, we investigate and compare the fabrication of quantum emitters in hBN and exfoliated muscovite mica flakes along with other 3D crystals, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, which are known to host quantum emitters. We used our primary fabrication technique of localized electron irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope. To complement our experimental work, we employed density functional theory simulations to study the atomic structures of defects in mica. While our fabrication technique allows one to create hBN quantum emitters with a high yield and high single photon purity, it is unable to fabricate single emitters in the other solid-state crystals under investigation. This allows us to draw conclusions on the emitter fabrication mechanism in hBN, which could rely on activating pre-existing defects by charge state manipulation. Therefore, we provide an essential step toward the identification of hBN emitters and their formation process.</summary>

    <title>Bandgap renormalization and excitonic binding in T-shaped quantum wires</title>

    <summary>  We calculate the electronic structure for a modulation doped and gated T-shaped quantum wire using density functional theory. We calculate the bandgap renormalization as a function of the density of conduction band electrons, induced by the donor layer and/or the gate, for the translationally invariant wire, incorporating all growth and geometric properties of the structure completely. We show that most of the bandgap renormalization arises from exchange-correlation effects, but that a small shift also results from the difference of wave function evolution between electrons and holes. We calculate the binding energy of excitons in the wire, which breaks translational invariance, using a simpler, cylindrical model of the wire. For a single hole and a one dimensional electron gas of density n_e, screening of the exciton binding energy is shown to approximately compensate for bandgap renormalization, suggesting that the recombination energy remains approximately constant with n_e, in agreement with experiment. We find that the nature of screening, as treated within our non-linear model, is significantly different from that of the various linear screening treatments, and the orthogonality of free carrier states with the bound electron states has a profound effect on the screening charge. We find that the electron and hole remain bound for all densities up to about 3 x 10^6 cm^{-1} and that, as n_e increases from zero, trion and even ``quadron'' formation becomes allowed.</summary>

    <summary>  In this paper we consider two different geometry of quasi one-dimensional semiconductors and calculate their exchange-correlation induced bandgap renormalization (BGR) as a function of the electron-hole plasma density and quantum wire width. Based on different fabrication scheme, we define suitable external confinement potential and then leading-order GW dynamical screening approximation is used in the calculation by treating electron-electron Coulomb interaction and electron-optical phonon interaction. Using a numerical scheme, screened Coulomb potential, probability of different states, profile of charge density and the values of the renormalized gap energy are calculated and the effects of variation of confinement potential width and temperature are studied.</summary>
