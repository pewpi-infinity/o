    <summary>Two-dimensional (2D) materials, composed of single atomic layers, have attracted vast research interest since the breakthrough discovery of graphene. One major benefit of such systems is the simple ability to tune the chemical potential by back-gating, in-principle enabling to vary the Fermi level through the charge neutrality point, thus tuning between electron and hole doping. For 2D Superconductors, this means that one may potentially achieve the strongly-coupled superconducting regime described by Bose Einstein Condensation physics of small bosonic tightly bound electron pairs. Furthermore, it should be possible to access both electron and hole based superconductivity in a single system. However, in most 2D materials, an insulating gap opens up around the charge neutrality point, thus preventing approach to this regime. Graphene is unique in this sense since it is a true semi-metal in which the un-gapped Dirac point is protected by the symmetries. In this work we show that single layer graphene, in which superconducting pairing is induced by proximity to regions of a low density superconductor, can be tuned from hole to electron superconductivity through the strong coupling regime. We study, both experimentally and theoretically, the vicinity of this "Superconducting Dirac point" and find an unusual situation where reflections at interfaces between normal and superconducting regions within the graphene, suppress the conductance and, at the same time, Andreev reflections maintain a large phase breaking length. In addition, the Fermi level can be adjusted so that the momentum in the normal and superconducting regimes perfectly match giving rise to ideal Andreev reflection processes.</summary>

    <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Strong Correlations and Unconventional Superconductivity in Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>

    <summary>Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a novel moiré material that exhibits both strong electronic correlations and unconventional superconductivity. However, spectroscopic studies of its electronic properties are lacking, and the nature of superconductivity and the corresponding order parameter in this system remain elusive. Here we perform high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of MATTG and reveal extensive regions of atomic reconstruction that favor mirror-symmetric stacking. In these regions, we observe a cascade of symmetry-breaking electronic transitions and doping-dependent band structure deformations similar to those realized in magic-angle bilayers, as expected theoretically given the commonality of flat bands. More strikingly, in a density window spanning two to three holes per moire unit cell, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity are manifest as pronounced dips in the tunneling conductance at the Fermi level accompanied by coherence peaks that become gradually suppressed at elevated temperatures and magnetic fields. The observed evolution of the conductance with doping is consistent with a gate-tunable transition from a gapped to a nodal superconductor, which we show theoretically is compatible with a sharp transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) superconductor with a nodal order parameter. Within this doping window, we also detect peak-dip-hump structures suggesting that superconductivity is driven by strong coupling to bosonic modes of MATTG. Our results pave the way for further understanding of superconductivity and correlated states in graphene-based moiré structures beyond twisted bilayers, where unconventional superconductivity and nodal pairing were reported.</summary>

    <title>Designing a path towards superconductivity through magnetic exchange in transition-metal intercalated bilayer graphene</title>

    <summary>This study examines the potential of superconductivity in transition metal (TM) intercalated bilayer graphene through a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties. We determine the electronic structure for all first row TM elements in the stable honeycomb configuration between two layers of graphene using density functional theory (DFT). Through an analysis of the electron density, we assess the induction of the magnetic moment in each case, where a comparison of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations allow us to ascertain an estimated exchange coupling between the transition-metal elements. By analyzing the electronic properties, we find that the carbon $p$-bands are degenerate with the TM $d$-bands and form an electron pocket below the Fermi energy at the $Γ-$point. These hybridized bands are analogous to the carbon $p$-band effect that produces superconductivity in intercalated graphite with alkali and alkaline-earth metals. Furthermore, since the bands are hybridized with the TM $d$-bands, their magnetic properties may provide bosonic modes from their spin-coupling to preserve the unique linear dispersion present in monolayer graphene. This study provides a designing route by using TMs for tuning magneto-electric Dirac materials and will encourage future experimental studies to further the fundamental knowledge of unconventional superconductivity.</summary>
