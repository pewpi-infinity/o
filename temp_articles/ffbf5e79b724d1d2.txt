    <summary>  The exploration of atomic properties of strongly coupled partially degenerate plasmas, also referred to as warm dense matter, is important in astrophysics, since this thermodynamic regime is encountered for instance in Jovian planets' interior. One of the most important issues is the need for accurate equations of state and transport coefficients. The Ziman formula has been widely used for the computation of the static (DC) electrical resistivity. Usually, the calculations are based on the continuum wavefunctions computed in the temperature and density-dependent self-consistent potential of a fictive atom, representing the average ionization state of the plasma (average-atom model). We present calculations of the electrical resistivity of a plasma based on the superconfiguration (SC) formalism. In this modeling, the contributions of all the electronic configurations are taken into account. It is possible to obtain all the situations between the two limiting cases: detailed configurations (a super-orbital is a single orbital) and detailed ions (all orbitals are gathered in the same super-orbital). The ingredients necessary for the calculation are computed in a self-consistent manner for each SC, using a density-functional description of the electrons. Electron exchange-correlation is handled in the local-density approximation. The momentum transfer cross-sections are calculated by using the phase shifts of the continuum electron wavefunctions computed, in the potential of each SC, by the Schroedinger equation with relativistic corrections (Pauli approximation). Comparisons with experimental data are also presented.</summary>

    <summary>The current understanding of some important nonlinear collective processes in quantum plasmas with degenerate electrons is presented. After reviewing the basic properties of quantum plasmas, we present model equations (e.g. the quantum hydrodynamic and effective nonlinear Schrödinger-Poisson equations) that describe collective nonlinear phenomena at nanoscales. The effects of the electron degeneracy arise due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pauli's exclusion principle for overlapping electron wavefunctions that result in tunneling of electrons and the electron degeneracy pressure. Since electrons are Fermions (spin-1/2), there also appears an electron spin current and a spin force acting on electrons due to the Bohr magnetization. The quantum effects produce new aspects of electrostatic (ES) and electromagnetic (EM) waves in a quantum plasma that are summarized in here. Furthermore, we discuss nonlinear features of ES ion waves and electron plasma oscillations (ESOs), as well as the trapping of intense EM waves in quantum electron density cavities. Specifically, simulation studies of the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) and Poisson equations reveal the formation and dynamics of localized ES structures at nanoscales in a quantum plasma. We also discuss the effect of an external magnetic field on the plasma wave spectra and develop quantum magnetohydrodynamic (Q-MHD) equations. The results are useful for understanding numerous collective phenomena in quantum plasmas, such as those in compact astrophysical objects, in plasma-assisted nanotechnology, and in the next-generation of intense laser-solid density plasma interaction experiments.</summary>

    <summary>Starting from the quantum hydrodynamic model and transforming to the coupled driven pseudoforce system the plasmonic excitations of electron beam with arbitrary degree of degeneracy are studied. Using the conventional normal-mode analysis a dual-length-scale wavefunction theory for a monochromatic electron beam is developed. The beam plasmon excitations are shown to have both wave and particle character, de Broglie wavenumbers of which depend on various parameters such as average beam speed, the chemical potential, the charge screening and the background electrostatic energy. The deterministic single electron dynamics in the beam is investigated using the dual-wavelength electrostatic potential energy. It is shown that electrons can be either trapped or traveling along the beam direction depending on the ambient plasma parameter values. The problem of monochromatic beam transport through binary as well as ternary metallic configurations are investigated and some technological applications of these system are pointed out. The theory is extended to multistream phenomenon and electron beam transport through multimedia junction. We believe that current study can have major impact on understanding of the quantum beam-plasma interactions and instabilities and can further elucidate the mechanisms involving in the collective quantum wave-particle phenomena.</summary>
