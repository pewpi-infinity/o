    <summary>  Extra Ordinary (X) mode conversion to Bernstein wave near Upper Hybrid Resonance (UHR) layer plays an important role in plasma heating through cyclotron resonance. Wave generation at UHR and parametric decay at high power has been observed during Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) heating experiments in toroidal magnetic fusion devices. A small linear system with ECR and UHR layer within the system has been used to conduct experiments on X-B conversion and parametric decay process as a function of system parameters. Direct probing {\em in situ} is conducted and plasma heating is evidenced by soft x-ray emission measurement. Experiments are performed with hydrogen plasma produced with 160-800 W microwave power at 2.45 GHz of operating frequency at $10^{-3}$ mbar pressure. The axial magnetic field required for ECR is such that the resonant surface (B = 875 G) is situated at the geometrical axis of the plasma system. Experimental results will be presented in the paper.</summary>

    <summary>Atmospheric pressure plasmas are effective sources for reactive species, making them applicable for industrial and biomedical applications. We quantify ground-state densities of key species, atomic oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H), produced from admixtures of water vapour (up to 0.5%) to the helium feed gas in a radio-frequency-driven plasma at atmospheric pressure. Absolute density measurements, using two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence, require accurate effective excited state lifetimes. For atmospheric pressure plasmas, picosecond resolution is needed due to the rapid collisional de-excitation of excited states. These absolute O and H density measurements, at the nozzle of the plasma jet, are used to benchmark a plug-flow, 0D chemical kinetics model, for varying humidity content, to further investigate the main formation pathways of O and H. It is found that impurities can play a crucial role for the production of O at small molecular admixtures. Hence, for controllable reactive species production, purposely admixed molecules to the feed gas is recommended, as opposed to relying on ambient molecules. The controlled humidity content was also identified as an effective tailoring mechanism for the O/H ratio.</summary>

    <title>Influence of surface materials on the volume production of negative ions in a radio-frequency driven hydrogen plasma</title>

    <summary>Negative atomic hydrogen ion (H$^{-}$) densities were measured in a pulsed low-pressure E-mode inductively-coupled radio-frequency (rf) driven plasma in hydrogen by means of laser photodetachment and a Langmuir probe. This investigation focuses on the influence of different metallic surface materials on the volume production of H$^{-}$ ions. The H$^{-}$ density was measured above a thin disc of either tungsten, stainless steel, copper, aluminium, or molybdenum placed onto the lower grounded electrode of the plasma device as a function of gas pressure and applied rf power. For copper, aluminium, and molybdenum the H$^{-}$ density was found to be quite insensitive to pressure and rf power, with values ranging between 3.6x10$^{14}$ to 5.8x10$^{14}$ m$^{-3}$. For stainless steel and tungsten, the H$^{-}$ dependency was found to be complex, apart from the case of a similar linear increase from 2.9x10$^{14}$ to 1.1x10$^{15}$ m$^{-3}$ with rf power at a pressure of 25 Pa. Two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence was used to measure the atomic hydrogen densities and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy was used to investigate whether the plasma dynamics were surface dependent. An explanation for the observed differences between the two sets of investigated materials is given in terms of surface reaction mechanisms for the creation of vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules.</summary>
