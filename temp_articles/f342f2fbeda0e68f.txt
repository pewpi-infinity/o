    <summary>Two-dimensional porous carbon nanomaterials are proven to be promising hydrogen storage substrates as they possess high surface area, large number of active sites, low molecular mass, and hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed on both sides of these materials. By performing first-principles density functional theory-based calculations, we report ultrahigh reversible hydrogen uptake in lithium decorated 2D carbon allotrope PAI-graphene, which is formed of a regular pattern of polymerized as-indacenes (PAI). We found that a single unit cell of PAI-graphene can be decorated by 8 Li atoms, in which each Li atom can reversibly adsorb 4 hydrogen molecules, leading to 15.7 % of H uptake, remarkably higher than the DOE demand of 6.5 %. Li atom donates its valence 2s-electron to PAI-graphene and gets ionized. The adsorption energies of the various H2 attached to Li-atom are found to be suitable for reversible use during practical applications. Hydrogen molecules get attached to the ionized metal atom by electrostatic interactions. An energy barrier of 1.48 eV is present for the diffusion of Li atoms between the two most stable adsorption sites which justifies the absence of the clustering of Li atoms.</summary>

    <summary>We have used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate two types of hydrogen defect structures on monolayer graphene supported by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a gated field-effect transistor configuration. The first H-defect type is created by bombarding graphene with 1-keV ionized hydrogen and is identified as two hydrogen atoms bonded to a graphene vacancy via comparison of experimental data to first-principles calculations. The second type of H defect is identified as dimerized hydrogen and is created by depositing atomic hydrogen having only thermal energy onto a graphene surface. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal that hydrogen dimers formed in this way open a new elastic channel in the tunneling conductance between an STM tip and graphene.</summary>

    <title>Tuning the pH Response of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride/Graphene Field-Effect Transistors</title>

    <summary>The chemical activity of ionized hydrogen describes the potency of protons in solution and is used to define the pH with wide-ranging applications in biological and materials sciences. Measuring pH with graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) has been described in the past but has yet to be characterized with a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. hBN capping is hypothesized to lower the chemical affinity of protons to oxidized defects in the graphene crystal and lower the standard deviation of pH measurement via screening charge density. First, the electronic properties of commercial, monolayer graphene and monolayer hBN/graphene, both on four-inch 90 nm SiO2/p-type Si, were contrasted as a function of solutal pH in 10 mM phosphate buffered solution. The two-dimensional (2D) FETs were fabricated with photoresistless metallization followed by microcentrifuge tube-masking and reactive ion etching to define a quasi-pure 2D sensing mesa for pH sensing. Thereafter, the devices were exposed to phosphate buffer of varying pH and the resistance and liquid-transfer characteristics measured. The hBN/graphene/SiO2 FETs had higher linearity, and both lower standard deviation and range of Dirac voltage shifting than monolayer graphene/SiO2. Then, before microcentrifuge tube-masking, freshly metallized devices were coated with 9 nm of Al2O3 by electron beam deposition. The Al2O3/graphene/SiO2 and Al2O3/hBN/graphene/SiO2 devices showed an altered response to the pH of the phosphate buffered solutions before and after basic etching of the Al2O3 with NaOH (pH = 12). This prompted studying the pH-dependencies of the 2D devices as a function of the thickness of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition. These results show that modifying the surface of monolayer graphene with nanoscale dielectrics enables tuning of the pH-dependent electronic properties of graphene pH sensors.</summary>
