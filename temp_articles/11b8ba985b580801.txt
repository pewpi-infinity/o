    <summary>We discuss the shape resonance in the superconducting gaps of a two band superconductor by tuning the chemical potential at a Lifshitz transition for Femi surface neck collapsing and for spot appearing. The high temperature superconducting scenario for complex matter shows the coexistence of a first BCS condensate made of Cooper pairs in the first band and a second boson-like condensate made of bosons like bipolarons, in the second band where the chemical potential is tuned near a Lifshitz transition. The interband coupling controls the shape resonance in the pair exchange between the two condensates. We discuss the particular BCS-Bose crossover that occurs at the shape resonance tuning the Lifshitz parameter (the energy difference between the chemical potential and the Lifshitz topological transition) like tuning the external magnetic field for the Feshbach resonances in ultracold gases. This superconducting phase provides a particular case of topological superconductivity with multiple condensates of different winding numbers</summary>

    <summary>  There continues to be enormous interest in the BCS to BEC transition as there still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance) superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW) isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair) has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a Feshbach resonance form of SC.</summary>

    <title>On the Boson-Fermion resonant model on a lattice</title>

    <summary>We review briefly the properties of a mixture of mutually interacting bosons (bound electron pairs) and itinerant fermions on a lattice (the boson-fermion model). The calculations of the superconducting phase transition temperature ($T_{c}$) and the phase diagram are the main concern. The self-consistent $T$-matrix method is applied to determine the superconducting critical temperature from a pseudogap phase. The method takes into account the pairing fluctuations effects. The $T$-matrix results for $T_{c}$ are given for a 3D cubic lattice with tight-binding dispersion of electrons and standard bosons, and they are also compared with those of the BCS- mean-field approximation (MFA). Our results describe the BCS-Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover in the boson-fermion mixture with resonant interaction. The energy scales involved in the pseudogap formation are also analysed.
