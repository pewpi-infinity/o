    <summary>How the superconductivity in unconventional superconductors emerges from the diverse mother normal states is still a big puzzle. Whatever the mother normal states are the superconductivity is {\em normal} with BCS-like behaviours of the paired quasiparticles in condensation. To reconcile the diverse mother normal states and the normal superconductivity in unconventional superconductors, we revisit a proposal that the emergence of the low-energy coherent parts of the physical electrons, which survive from the interaction correlations, is an essential prerequisite for superconductivity. The superconductivity is driven by the pair condensation of these coherent parts of the physical electrons. Moreover the incoherent parts of the physical electrons can enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ although they are not in driving role in the emergence of the superconductivity. Some experimental responses of the coherent parts of the physical electrons are predicted.</summary>

    <summary>How the macroscopic quantum coherence can resist to the decoherence attacks of high temperature is a major challenge for the science of the 21st century. Superstripes 2017 conference held in Ischia on June 2017 has been focused on the new physics of high $T_c$ superconductors made of complex quantum matter. Today the standard model of high $T_c$ superconductivity which grabs the physics of complex quantum matter is the multi-band Hubbard model where the dome of $T_c$ occurs by driving the chemical potential in the proximity of a topological Lifshitz transition. The multi-gap superconductivity in the $T_c$ dome is driven by exchange interaction between a condensate in the BEC-BCS crossover which coexists with second BCS condensates. The proximity to Lifshitz transitions in correlated electronic systems gives the ubiquitous arrested phase separation observed in all high temperature superconductors. Non Euclidean filamentary hyperbolic geometry is needed for the space description of superstripes textures produced by the coexistence of short range CDW puddles, hole poor SDW puddles and self organized dopants rich puddles. A road map to room temperature superconductors in particular organic compounds made of superlattices of quantum wires driven by Fano resonances with one of the condensates in the BEC-BCS crossover has been proposed.</summary>

    <title>Antiadiabatic Phonons and Superconductivity in Eliashberg-McMillan Theory</title>

    <summary>The standard Eliashberg - McMillan theory of superconductivity is essentially based on the adiabatic approximation. Here we present some simple estimates of electron - phonon interaction within Eliashberg - McMillan approach in non - adiabatic and even antiadiabatic situation, when characteristic phonon frequency $Ω_0$ becomes large enough, i.e. comparable or exceeding the Fermi energy $E_F$. We discuss the general definition of Eliashberg - McMillan (pairing) electron - phonon coupling constant $λ$, taking into account the finite value of phonon frequencies. We show that the mass renormalization of electrons is in general determined by different coupling constant $\tildeλ$, which takes into account the finite width of conduction band, and describes the smooth transition from the adiabatic regime to the region of strong nonadiabaticity. In antiadiabatic limit, when $Ω_0\gg E_F$, the new small parameter of perturbation theory is $λ\frac{E_F}{Ω_0}\simλ\frac{D}{Ω_0}\ll 1$ ($D$ is conduction band half -- width), and corrections to electronic spectrum (mass renormalization) become irrelevant. However, the temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in antiadiabatic limit is still determined by Eliashberg - McMillan coupling constant $λ$. We consider in detail the model with discrete set of (optical) phonon frequencies. A general expression for superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is derived, which is valid in situation, when one (or several) of such phonons becomes antiadiabatic. We also analyze the contribution of such phonons into the Coulomb pseudopotential $μ^{\star}$ and show, that antiadiabatic phonons do not contribute to Tolmachev's logarithm and its value is determined by partial contributions from adiabatic phonons only.</summary>
