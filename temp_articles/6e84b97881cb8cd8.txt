    <summary>The most intriguing observation of cuprate experiments is most likely the metal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the underdome region of the temperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic field, when the superconductivity is suppressed. This MIC, which results in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio, nonlinear entropy, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and Fermi pockets, reveals the nonconventional dielectric property of the pseudogap-normal phase. Since conventional superconductivity appears from a conducting normal phase, the understanding of how superconductivity arises from an insulating state becomes a fundamental problem and thus the keystone for all of cuprate physics. Recently, in interpreting the physics of visualization in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) real space nanoregions (NRs), which exhibit an energy gap, we have succeeded in understanding that the minimum size for these NRs provides pseudogap and superconductivity pairs, which are single bosons. In this work, we discuss the intra-particle magnetic spin and charge fluctuations of these bosons, observed recently in hidden magnetic order and STM experiments. We find that all the mentioned MIC phenomena can be obtained in the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of sample percolating NRs of single fermions into those of single bosons.</summary>

    <title>Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero temperature</title>

    <summary>We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system which differs with respect to the familiar Schrödinger-like one. From this point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schrödinger equation. One of the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.</summary>

    <title>Metal-insulator (fermion-boson)-crossover origin of pseudogap phase of cuprates I: anomalous heat conductivity, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy</title>

    <summary>Among all experimental observations of cuprate physics, the metal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the pseudogap (PG) region of the temperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic field, when the superconductivity is suppressed, is most likely the most intriguing one. Since it was expected that the PG-normal state for these materials, as for conventional superconductors, is conducting. This MIC, revealed in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy, resistivity temperature upturn, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and Fermi pockets, unambiguously indicates on the insulating normal state, from which the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) appears. In the present work (article I), we discuss the MIC phenomena mentioned in the title of article. The second work (article II) will be devoted to discussion of other listed above MIC phenomena and also to interpretation of the recent observations in the hidden magnetic order and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments spin and charge fluctuations as the intra PG and HTS pair ones. We find that all these MIC (called in the literature as non-Fermi liquid) phenomena can be obtained within the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of single fermions into those of single bosons. We show that this MIC originates from bosons of Coulomb two liquid model and fermions, whose origin is these bosons. At an increase of doping up to critical value or temperature up to PG boundary temperature, the boson system undegoes bosonic insulator - bosonic metal - fermionic metal transitions.</summary>
