    <summary>Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\le$ 600 $^{\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\sim$ 1 $μ$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($&lt;$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.</summary>

    <title>Feature-specific correlation of structural, optical, and chemical properties in the transmission electron microscope with hypermodal data fusion</title>

    <summary>Modern TEM instrumentation can probe a wide range of structural, optical, and chemical properties with unprecedented resolution. However, each of these properties must be recorded in independent datasets using different detector modes with no unifying framework currently available for quantitatively mapping their relationships onto chemically distinct features, particularly in complex morphologies. Here, we tackle this challenge by proposing a data acquisition and analysis workflow called "hypermodal data fusion," describing how to directly couple an arbitrary number of highly disparate detector modes including spectroscopy and scanning diffraction and jointly analyze them for correlations. We demonstrate this concept on a random collection of anatase and rutile nanoparticles, first detailing how to use core-loss EELS to unmix the different polymorphs despite three-dimensional overlap along the beam direction and then showing how this can be used to extract polymorph-specific composition, bandgaps, and crystal structure. We conclude with a discussion on the applicability of this workflow for a broad range of materials systems.</summary>

    <title>Electronic coupling in colloidal quantum dot molecules; The case of CdSe/CdS core/shell homodimers</title>

    <summary>Coupled colloidal quantum dot molecules composed of two fused CdSe/CdS core/shell sphere monomers were recently presented. Upon fusion, the potential energy landscape is changing into two quantum dots separated by a pre-tuned potential barrier with energetics dictated by the conduction and valence band offsets of the core/shell semiconductors, and width controlled by the shell thickness and the fusion reaction conditions. In close proximity of the two nanocrystals, orbital hybridization occurs, forming bonding and anti-bonding states in analogy to the hydrogen molecule. In this study, we examine theoretically the electronic and optical signatures of such a quantum dot dimer compared to its monomer core/shell building blocks. We examine the effects of different core sizes, barrier widths, different band offsets and neck sizes at the interface of the fused facets, on the system wave-functions and energetics. Due to the higher effective mass of the hole and the large valence band offset, the hole still essentially resides in either of the cores breaking the symmetry of the potential for the electron as well. We found that the dimer signature is well expressed in a redshift of the bandgap both in absorption and emission, in slower radiative lifetimes and in an absorption cross-section which is significantly enhanced relative to the monomers at energies above the shell absorption onset, while remains essentially at the same level near the band-edge. This study provides essential guidance to pre-design of coupled quantum dot molecules with specific attributes which can be utilized for various new optoelectronic applications.</summary>
