    <summary>Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moiré-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new topological phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character, which may explain why superconductivity appears with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.</summary>

    <summary>The effects of a propagating sinusoidal out-of-plane flexural deformation in the electronic properties of a tense membrane of graphene are considered within a non-perturbative approach, leading to an electron-ripple coupling. The deformation is taken into account by introducing its corresponding pseudo-vector and pseudo-scalar potentials in the Dirac equation. By using a transformation to the time-cone of the strain wave, the Dirac equation is reduced to an ordinary second-order differential Matthieu equation, i.e., to a parametric pendulum, giving a spectrum of bands and gaps determined by resonance conditions between the electron and ripple wave-vector (G), and their incidence angles. The location of the nth gap is thus determined by $E\approx n v_{F}\hbar G$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. Physically, gaps are produced by diffraction of electrons in phase with the wave. The propagation is mainly in the direction of the ripple. In the case of a pure pseudoelectric field and for energies lower than a certain threshold, we found a different kind of equation. Its analytical solutions are in excellent agreement with the numerical solutions. The wavefunctions can be expressed in terms of the Matthieu cosine and sine functions, and for the case of a pure pseudo-electric potential, as a combination of Bessel functions.</summary>

    <summary>The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</summary>
