    <summary>Hydrogen compounds are peculiar as the quantum nature of the proton can crucially affect their structural and physical properties. A remarkable example are the high-pressure phases of H$_2$O, where quantum proton fluctuations favor the symmetrization of the H bond and lower by 30 GPa the boundary between the asymmetric structure and the symmetric one. Here we show that an analogous quantum symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride superconductor with the record superconducting critical temperature $T_c=203$ K at 155 GPa. In this system, according to classical theory, superconductivity occurs via formation of a structure of stoichiometry H$_3$S with S atoms arranged on a body-centered-cubic (bcc) lattice. For $P \gtrsim 175$ GPa, the H atoms are predicted to sit midway between two S atoms, in a structure with $Im\bar3m$ symmetry. At lower pressures the H atoms move to an off-center position forming a short H$-$S covalent bond and a longer H$\cdots$S hydrogen bond, in a structure with $R3m$ symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments confirmed the H$_3$S stoichiometry and the S lattice sites, but were unable to discriminate between the two phases. Our present ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the quantum nuclear motion lowers the symmetrization pressure by 72 GPa. Consequently, we predict that the $Im\bar3m$ phase is stable over the whole pressure range within which a high $T_c$ was measured. The observed pressure-dependence of $T_c$ is closely reproduced in our calculations for the $Im\bar3m$ phase, but not for the $R3m$ phase. Thus, the quantum nature of the proton completely rules the superconducting phase diagram of H$_3$S.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Incompressibility of a Freely Falling Hydrogen Atom in a Circular Rydberg State, and a Gravitationally-Induced Charge Separation Effect in Superconducting Systems</title>

    <summary>Freely falling point-like objects converge toward the center of the Earth. Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the superconducting system.
  A "Cavendish-like" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational perturbations are present.</summary>

    <title>Quantum anharmonic enhancement of superconductivity in $P6_3/mmc$ ScH$_6$ at high pressures: a first-principles study</title>

    <summary>Making use of first-principles calculations, we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of P63/mmc ScH6 in the 100-160 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a strong correction to the crystal structure, the phonon spectra, and the superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Quantum ionic fluctuations have a large impact on the H2 molecular-like units present in the crystal by increasing the hydrogen-hydrogen distance about a 5%. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure will be dynamically stable at least above 85 GPa, which is 45 GPa lower than the pressure given by the harmonic approximation. Contrary to many superconducting hydrogen-rich compounds, where quantum ionic effects and the consequent anharmonicity tend to lower the superconducting critical temperature, our results show that it can be enhanced in P63/mmc ScH6 by approximately a 15%. We attribute the enhancement of the critical temperature to the stretching of the H$_2$ molecular-like units and the associated increase of the electron-phonon interaction. Our results suggest that quantum ionic effects increase the superconducting critical temperature in hydrogen-rich materials with H2 units by increasing the hydrogen-hydrogen distance and, consequently, the electron-phonon interaction.</summary>
