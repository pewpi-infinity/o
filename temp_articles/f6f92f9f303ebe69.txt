    <summary>The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10 (Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches 2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts for clean fuel production.</summary>

    <summary>High-entropy oxides (HEOs), containing at least five principal cations, have recently emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Despite their high potential, the impact of the cation mixtures on photocatalytic activity remains poorly understood. This study investigates the high-entropy photocatalyst TiZrHfNbTaO11 using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods to elucidate the effects of various elements on electronic structure and water splitting performance. The results indicate that the HEO exhibits a bandgap comparable to TiO2 polymorphs rutile, brookite and anatase. Cations with lower electronegativity, such as hafnium and zirconium, provide the strongest water adsorption energy, serving as active sites for water adsorption. Additionally, the co-presence of highly electronegative cations like niobium and tantalum adjacent to hafnium and zirconium enhances charge transfer to water molecules, improving splitting efficiency. These findings suggest novel strategies for designing high-entropy photocatalysts by synergistic incorporating cations with different electronegativities.</summary>

    <title>Mixed atomic-scale electronic configuration as a strategy to avoid cocatalyst utilization in photocatalysis by high-entropy oxides</title>

    <summary>To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.</summary>
