    <summary>One-dimensional (1D) systems and models provide a versatile platform for emergent phenomena induced by strong electron correlation. In this work, we extend the newly developed real space neural network quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the quantum phase transition of electronic and magnetic properties. Hydrogen chains of different interatomic distances are explored systematically with both open and periodic boundary conditions, and fully correlated ground state many-body wavefunction is achieved via unsupervised training of neural networks. We demonstrate for the first time that neural networks are capable of capturing the quantum critical behavior of Tomonaga- Luttinger liquid (TLL), which is known to dominate 1D quantum systems. Moreover, we reveal the breakdown of TLL phase and the emergence of a Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by abrupt changes in the spin structure and the momentum distribution. Such behavior is absent in commonly studied 1D lattice models and is likely due to the involvement of high-energy orbitals of hydrogen atoms. Our work highlights the powerfulness of neural networks for representing complex quantum phases.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Incompressibility of a Freely Falling Hydrogen Atom in a Circular Rydberg State, and a Gravitationally-Induced Charge Separation Effect in Superconducting Systems</title>

    <summary>Freely falling point-like objects converge toward the center of the Earth. Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the superconducting system.
  A "Cavendish-like" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational perturbations are present.</summary>

    <title>Unbiasing Fermionic Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matrix Product State Trial Wavefunctions</title>

    <summary>In this work, we report, for the first time, an implementation of fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) using matrix product state (MPS) trial wavefunctions, dubbed MPS-AFQMC. Calculating overlaps between an MPS trial and arbitrary Slater determinants up to a multiplicative error, a crucial subroutine in MPS-AFQMC, is proven to be #P-hard. Nonetheless, we tested several promising heuristics in successfully improving fermionic phaseless AFQMC energies. We also proposed a way to evaluate local energy and force bias evaluations free of matrix product operators. This allows for larger basis set calculations without significant overhead. We showcase the utility of our approach on one- and two-dimensional hydrogen lattices, even when the MPS trial itself struggles to obtain high accuracy. Our work offers a new set of tools that can solve currently challenging electronic structure problems with future improvements.</summary>
