    <summary>Crystal calorimeters have a long history of pushing the frontier on high-resolution electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry. We explore in this paper major innovations in collider detector performance that can be achieved with crystal calorimetry when longitudinal segmentation and dual-readout capabilities are combined with a new high EM resolution approach to PFA in multi-jet events, such as $e^+e^+\rightarrow HZ$ events in all-hadronic final-states at Higgs factories. We demonstrate a new technique for pre-processing $π^0$ momenta through combinatoric di-photon pairing in advance of applying jet algorithms. This procedure significantly reduces $π^0$ photon splitting across jets in multi-jet events. The correct photon-to-jet assignment efficiency improves by a factor of 3 with a $3\%/\sqrt{E}$ EM resolution. In addition, the technique of bremsstrahlung photon recovery significantly improves electron momentum measurements. A high EM resolution calorimeter increases the Z boson recoil mass resolution in Higgstrahlung events for decays into electron pairs to 80% of that for muon pairs. We present the design and optimization of a highly segmented crystal detector concept that achieves the required energy resolution, and a time resolution better than 30 ps providing exceptional particle identification capabilities. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous detector designs that suffered from large neutral hadron resolution degradation from one interaction length of crystals in front of a sampling hadron calorimeter, the implementation of dual-readout on crystals permits to achieve a resolution better than $30\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2\%$ for neutral hadrons. Our studies find that the integration of crystal calorimetry into future Higgs factory collider detectors can open new perspectives by yielding the highest level of combined EM and neutral hadron resolution in the PFA paradigm.</summary>

    <title>Performance of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

    <summary>The operation and performance of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) are presented, based on data collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, in the years from 2015 to 2018 (LHC Run 2), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 151 fb$^{-1}$. The CMS ECAL is a scintillating lead-tungstate crystal calorimeter, with a silicon strip preshower detector in the forward region that provides precise measurements of the energy and the time-of-arrival of electrons and photons. The successful operation of the ECAL is crucial for a broad range of physics goals, ranging from observing the Higgs boson and measuring its properties, to other standard model measurements and searches for new phenomena. Precise calibration, alignment, and monitoring of the ECAL response are important ingredients to achieve these goals. To face the challenges posed by the higher luminosity, which characterized the operation of the LHC in Run 2, the procedures established during the 2011-2012 run of the LHC have been revisited and new methods have been developed for the energy measurement and for the ECAL calibration. The energy resolution of the calorimeter, for electrons from Z boson decays reaching the ECAL without significant loss of energy by bremsstrahlung, was better than 1.8%, 3.0%, and 4.5% in the $\lvertη\rvert$ intervals [0.0, 0.8], [0.8, 1.5], [1.5, 2.5], respectively. This resulting performance is similar to that achieved during Run 1 in 2011-2012, in spite of the more severe running conditions.</summary>
