    <summary>The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers. Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light emission in atomically thin semiconductors.</summary>

    <title>Mixed atomic-scale electronic configuration as a strategy to avoid cocatalyst utilization in photocatalysis by high-entropy oxides</title>

    <summary>To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.</summary>

    <title>Entropy and Seebeck signals meet on the edges</title>

    <summary>We explore the electronic entropy per particle $s$ and Seebeck coefficient $\mathcal{S}$ in zigzag graphene ribbons. Pristine and edge-doped ribbons are considered using tight-binding models to inspect the role of edge states in the observed thermal transport properties. As a bandgap opens when the ribbons are doped at one or both edges, due to asymmetric edge potentials, we find that $s$ and $\mathcal{S}$ signals are closely related to each other: both develop sharp dip-peak lineshapes as the chemical potential lies in the gap, while the ratio $s/\mathcal{S}$ exhibits a near constant value equal to the elementary charge $e$ at low temperatures. This constant ratio suggests that $\mathcal{S}$ can be seen as the transport differential entropy per charge, as suggested by some authors. Our calculations also indicate that measurement of $s$ and $\mathcal{S}$ may be useful as a spectroscopic probe of different electronic energy scales involved in such quantities in gapped materials.</summary>
