    <summary>Graphene holds great promise for post-silicon electronics, however, it faces two main challenges: opening up a bandgap and finding a suitable substrate material. In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate provides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical studies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent experimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density functional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied graphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on the order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect to hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if graphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone) exhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN is due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as misalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is robust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by about 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the graphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate that hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the field effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could open up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.</summary>

    <summary>Graphene is of interest in the development of next-generation electronics due to its high electron mobility, flexibility and stability. However, graphene transistors have poor on/off current ratios because of the absence of a bandgap. One approach to introduce an energy gap is to use hydrogenation reaction, which changes graphene into insulating graphane with sp3 bonding. Here we show that an electric field can be used to control conductor-to-insulator transitions in microscale graphene via a reversible electrochemical hydrogenation in an organic liquid electrolyte containing dissociative hydrogen ions. The fully hydrogenated graphene exhibits a lower limit sheet resistance of 200 Gohm/sq, resulting in graphene field-effect transistors with on/off current ratios of 10^8 at room temperature. The devices also exhibit high endurance, with up to one million switching cycles. Similar insulating behaviours are also observed in bilayer graphene, while trilayer graphene remains highly conductive after the hydrogenation. Changes in the graphene lattice, and the transformation from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, is confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by first-principles calculations.</summary>

    <title>Me-graphane: tailoring the structural and electronic properties of Me-graphene by hydrogenation</title>

    <summary>Graphene-based materials (GBMs) constitute a large family of materials which has attracted great interest for potential applications. In this work, we apply first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structural and electronic effects of hydrogenation in Me-graphene, a non-zero bandgap GBM composed of both $sp^2$ and $sp^3$-hybridized carbon. Our DFT results show a substantial tuning of the electronic properties of Me-graphene by hydrogenation, with the bandgap varying from $0.64$ eV to $2.81$ eV in the GGA-PBE approach, passing through metallic ground-states and a narrower bandgap state depending on the hydrogen coverage. The analyses of structural properties and binding energies have shown that hydrogenated Me-graphene presents strong and stable \ce{C-H} bonds, and all of the carbon atoms are in $sp^3$ hybridization resulting in a boat-like favorable conformation for fully-hydrogenated Me-graphene. Our MD simulations have indicated that the hydrogenation of Me-graphene is temperature-dependent, and the covalent adsorption tends to grow by islands. Those simulations also show that the most favorable site, predicted by our DFT calculations, acts as trigger adsorption for the extensive hydrogenation.</summary>
