    <summary>A comprehensive literature review on recently rediscovered Co- and/or CoNi-based superalloys, strengthened by the γ' phase, revealed a relationship between the configurational entropy of the system and the γ' solvus temperature. This study was conducted on a high Cr CoNi-based superalloy system with high configurational entropy to test our hypothesis based on the sustainable metallurgy framework. Thermodynamic calculations were performed to design the chemical compositions, followed by vacuum casting and heat treatments to produce the desired alloys. The microstructures were characterized using a scanning electron microscope, electron backscattered diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and differential thermal analysis. Microhardness and nanoindentation tests were employed to measure the mechanical properties. The results showed that both the configurational entropy and the type of alloying elements determine the final high-temperature performance of the alloys. We found that to enhance the higher γ' solvus temperature, the configurational entropy should be increased by adding γ' stabilizing elements. The microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the designed alloys before and after heat treatments are discussed in detail. The outcome of this study is beneficial for developing cobalt-based high-entropy superalloys with appropriate processing windows and freezing ranges for advanced sustainable manufacturing purposes, such as using powder bed fusion technologies.</summary>

    <title>On entanglement entropy in non-Abelian lattice gauge theory and 3D quantum gravity</title>

    <summary>Entanglement entropy is a valuable tool for characterizing the correlation structure of quantum field theories. When applied to gauge theories, subtleties arise which prevent the factorization of the Hilbert space underlying the notion of entanglement entropy. Borrowing techniques from extended topological field theories, we introduce a new definition of entanglement entropy for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Being based on the notion of excitations, it provides a completely relational way of defining regions. Therefore, it naturally applies to background independent theories, e.g. gravity, by circumventing the difficulty of specifying the position of the entangling surface. We relate our construction to earlier proposals and argue that it brings these closer to each other. In particular, it yields the non-Abelian analogue of the "magnetic centre choice", as obtained through an extended-Hilbert-space method, but applied to the recently introduced fusion basis for 3D lattice gauge theories. We point out that the different definitions of entanglement theory can be related to a choice of (squeezed) vacuum state.</summary>

    <title>Conformal bootstrap to Rényi entropy in 2D Liouville and super-Liouville CFTs</title>

    <summary>The Rényi entanglement entropy (REE) of the states excited by local operators in two-dimensional irrational conformal field theories (CFTs), especially in Liouville field theory (LFT) and $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Liouville field theory (SLFT), has been investigated. In particular, the excited states obtained by acting on the vacuum with primary operators were considered. {We start from evaluating the second REE in a compact $c=1$ free boson field theory at generic radius, which is an irrational CFT. Then we focus on the two special irrational CFTs, e.g., LFT and SLFT. In these theories, the second REE of such local excited states becomes divergent in early and late time limits. For simplicity, we study the memory effect of REE for the two classes of the local excited states in LFT and SLFT. In order to restore the quasiparticles picture, we define the difference of REE between target and reference states, which belong to the same class. The variation of the difference of REE between early and late time limits always coincides with the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between target and reference states. Furthermore, the locally excited states by acting generic descendent operators on the vacuum have been also investigated. The variation of the difference of REE is the summation of the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between the target and reference states, and an additional normalization factor. Since the identity operator (or vacuum state) does not live in the Hilbert space of LFT and SLFT and no discrete terms contribute to REE in the intermediate channel, the variation of the difference of REE between target and reference states is no longer the log of the quantum dimension which is shown in the 1+1-dimensional rational CFTs (RCFTs).</summary>
