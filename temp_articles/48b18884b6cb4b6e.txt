    <summary>  Boron in MgB_2 forms layers of honeycomb lattices with magnesium as a space filler. Band structure calculations indicate that Mg is substantially ionized, and the bands at the Fermi level derive mainly from B orbitals. Strong bonding with an ionic component and considerable metallic density of states yield a sizeable electron-phonon coupling. Using the rigid atomic sphere approximation and an analogy to Al, we estimate the coupling constant lambda to be of order 1. Together with high phonon frequencies, which we estimate via zone-center frozen phonon calculations to be between 300 and 700 cm^-1, this produces a high critical temperature, consistent with recent experiments reporting Tc=39 K (J. Akimitsu et al., to be published). Thus MgB_2 can be viewed as an analog of the long sought, but still hypothetical, superconducting metallic hydrogen.</summary>

    <title>Coulomb-oscillator origin of superconductivity in p-doped copper oxides</title>

    <summary>Emergence, development and cessation of superconductivity in three representative compounds of copper oxide families---cation doped Ca_2-xNa_xCuO2Cl2 and La_2-xAe_xCuO4 (Ae = Ba, Sr), as well as oxygen enriched YBa2Cu3O_6+x ---are explained with the Coulomb-oscillator model of superconductivity. By the model, non-resistive current is carried by axial Coulomb oscillations of s electrons through neighbor nuclei---here excited 3s electrons from O^2- ions through next-nearest neighbor oxygen nuclei---if their accompanying lateral oscillation is sufficiently confined to prevent lateral overswing. Cation doping gives rise to a superlattice in the layers that sandwich each CuO2 plane. In Ca_2-xNa_xCuO2Cl2, having one CuO2 plane per unit cell, superconductivity emerges when laterally confined Coulomb oscillators start connecting along 6 x 6 superlattice domains (in units of planar lattice constants) and it peaks at 4 x 4 domains when, at doping x = 1/8, the superlattice is completed. With further doping a new, off-set superlattice grows. Its frustrating effect gradually reduces superconductivity to cessation. The same mechanism holds for La_2-xAe_xCuO4 which has two, staggered CuO2 planes per unit cell. The staggering causes superconducting frustration or boost between adjacent layer sandwiches. This results in a double hump of the transition temperature Tc(x), instead of a dome, with a deep furrow or dip at x = 1/8 for Ae = Ba or Sr, respectively. Oxygen enrichment of YBa2Cu3O_6+x indirectly leads to effective doping in the CuO2 planes themselves (Cu^2+ --&gt; Cu^3+). The ionization of copper ions at the corners of planar unit cells determines whether lateral oscillations between next-nearest neighbor O^2- ions overswing (Tc = 0) or are confined to wide or narrow electron tracks. Their percolating connectivity gives rise to respective plateaus of Tc = 57 K and Tc = 90 K, and intermediate ramps.</summary>

    <title>Metallization of hydrogen by intercalating ammonium ions in metal fcc lattices at low pressure</title>

    <summary>Metallic hydrogen is capable of showing room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental syntheses are extremely hard. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the synthesis pressure of metallic hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization of hydrogen by "chemical precompression" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still requires relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve high-temperature superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting ammonium ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the periodic table reveal 12 elements which can form kinetically stable and superconducting hydrides at low pressures, where the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up to 118.40, 105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to atomic H, facilitating metallization of hydrogen under mild pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships, one is the H-atom charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first ionization energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature. Besides, ZnN2H8, CdN2H8, and HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure, and the presence of interstitial electrons suggests that they are also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78, and 3.05 eV) imply that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.</summary>
