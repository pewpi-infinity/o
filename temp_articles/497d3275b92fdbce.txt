    <summary>We investigate the sensitivity of future high-energy muon colliders to heavy Majorana neutrinos, considering both opposite-sign ($μ^+μ^-$) and same-sign ($μ^+μ^+$) collision modes. We focus on $μ^+μ^-$ colliders operating at centre-of-mass energies of 1, 3 and 10 TeV, as well as the proposed $μ$TRISTAN facility at 2 TeV, and we analyse the production of heavy neutrinos via vector boson fusion in the $t$-channel, a mechanism that becomes dominant in the multi-TeV regime. We evaluate its exclusion potential in terms of the heavy neutrino mass and the mixing of the heavy neutrino with its Standard Model counterparts, using both cut-based selections and boosted decision trees trained to exploit the distinct kinematic signatures of heavy Majorana neutrino exchanges. Our results demonstrate the complementarity between collider configurations, and show that active-sterile mixing angles as small as 0.001 could be probed for neutrino masses up to 100 TeV, an experimentally inaccessible region of the parameter space at current facilities. Altogether, this work establishes the discovery potential of muon colliders for testing super-heavy Majorana neutrinos, complementary to conventional probes, and provides compelling motivation for the next generation of high-energy lepton colliders.</summary>

    <title>Nuclear Muon Capture in Hydrogen and its Interplay with Muon Atomic Physics</title>

    <summary>  The singlet capture rate $Λ_S$ for the semileptonic weak process $μ+p \to n+ν_μ$ has been measured in the MuCap experiment. The novel experimental technique is based on stopping muons in an active target, consisting of a time projection chamber operating with ultra-pure hydrogen. This allows the unambiguous determination of the pseudoscalar form factor $g_P$ of the charged electroweak current of the nucleon. Our first result $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m^2_μ) = 7.3 \pm 1.1 $ is consistent with accurate theoretical predictions and constitutes an important test of QCD symmetries. Additional data are being collected with the aim of a three-fold reduction of the experimental uncertainties. Building on the developed advanced techniques, the new MuSun experiment is being planned to measure the muon capture rate on the deuteron to 1.5% precision. This would provide the by far most accurate experimental information on the axial current interacting with the two-nucleon system and determine the low energy constant $L_{1A}$ relevant for solar neutrino reactions.
  Muon induced atomic and molecular processes represent challenges as well as opportunities for this science program, and their interplay with the main nuclear and weak-interaction physics aspects will be discussed.</summary>

    <title>Revealing the origin of neutrino masses through the Type II Seesaw mechanism at high-energy muon colliders</title>

    <summary>The future muon collider can play as an ideal machine to search for new physics at high energies. In this work, we study the search potential of the heavy Higgs triplet in the Type II Seesaw mechanism at muon colliders with high collision energy and high luminosity. The latest neutrino oscillation data are taken into account for realizing the leptonic decay modes of the charged Higgs bosons $(H^{\pm\pm},~H^{\pm})$ in the Type II Seesaw. We show the impact of neutrino mass and mixing parameters on the purely leptonic decays. The pair production of doubly charged Higgs $H^{++}H^{--}$ is through direct $μ^+μ^-$ annihilation and vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at muon collider. The associated production $H^{\pm\pm}H^{\mp}$ can only be induced by VBF processes. We simulate both the purely leptonic and bosonic signal channels of charged Higgs bosons in Type II Seesaw, together with the Standard Model backgrounds. We show the required luminosity for the discovery of the charged Higgses and the reachable limits on the leptonic decay branching fractions.</summary>
