    <summary>Hydrogen adatoms are one of the most the promising proposals for the functionalization of graphene. Hydrogen induces narrow resonances near the Dirac energy, which lead to the formation of magnetic moments. Furthermore, they also create local lattice distortions which enhance the spin-orbit coupling. The combination of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling allows for a rich variety of phases, some of which have non trivial topological features. We analyze the interplay between magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in ordered arrays of hydrogen on graphene monolayers, and classify the different phases that may arise. We extend our model to consider arrays of adsorbates in graphene-like crystals with stronger intrinsic spin-orbit couplings.</summary>

    <summary>Hydrogen adsorption on graphene can be increased by functionalization with Ti. This requires dispersing Ti islands on graphene as small and dense as possible, in order to increase the number of hydrogen adsorption sites per Ti atom. In this report, we investigate the morphology of Ti on nanocrystalline graphene and its hydrogen adsorption by scanning tunneling microscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy, and compare the results with equivalent measurements on single-crystalline graphene. Nanocrystalline graphene consists of extremely small crystal grains of &lt; 5 nm size. Ti atoms preferentially adsorb at the grain boundaries of nanocrystalline graphene and form smaller and denser islands compared to single-crystalline graphene. Surprisingly, however, hydrogen adsorbs less to Ti on nanocrystalline graphene than to Ti on single-crystalline graphene. In particular, hydrogen hardly chemisorbs to 1 ML of Ti on nanocrystalline graphene. This may be attributed to strong bonds between Ti and defects located along the grain boundaries in nanocrystalline graphene. This mechanism might apply to other metals, as well, and therefore our results suggest that when functionalizing graphene by metal atoms for the purpose of hydrogen storage or other chemical reactions, it is important to consider not only the morphology of the resulting surface, but also the influence of graphene on the electronic states of the metal.</summary>

    <title>Enhanced hydrogen-gas permeation through rippled graphene</title>

    <summary>The penetration of atomic hydrogen through defect-free graphene was generally predicted to have a barrier of at least several eV, which is much higher than the 1 eV barrier measured for hydrogen-gas permeation through pristine graphene membranes. Herein, our density functional theory calculations show that ripples, which are ubiquitous in atomically thin crystals and mostly overlooked in the previous simulations, can significantly reduce the barriers for all steps constituting the mechanism of hydrogen-gas permeation through graphene membranes, including dissociation of hydrogen molecules, reconstruction of the dissociated hydrogen atoms and their flipping across graphene. Especially, the flipping barrier of hydrogen atoms from a cluster configuration is found to decrease rapidly down to &lt;1 eV with increasing ripples' curvature. The estimated hydrogen permeation rates by fully considering the distribution of ripples with all realistic curvatures and the major reaction steps that occurred on them are quite close to the experimental measurements. Our work provides insights into the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-gas permeation through graphene membranes and emphasizes the importance of nanoscale non-flatness (ripples) in explaining many surface and transport phenomena (for example, functionalization, corrosion and separation) in graphene and other two-dimensional materials.</summary>
