    <summary>Medium or high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) and rhenium-based compounds with a non-centrosymmetric (NC) structure have received a lot of attention for offering a fertile soil in search for unconventional superconductivity. Here, five previously unreported NC Re-based MEA-HEA superconductors with an $α$-Mn lattice are successfully synthesized, with their superconducting transition temperatures (Tcs) ranging from 4 to 5 K. An increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be achieved by modulating the valence electron count (VEC) through compositional adjustments. Magnetization measurements confirm that all the synthesized Re-based MEA-HEAs are bulk type-II superconductors. Specific heat analysis reveals that the superconducting state of these HEAs can be well described by a single-gap s-wave model. Our results show that the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of these $α$-Mn MEA/HEA superconductors are close to the typical value of heavy fermion compounds, suggesting the existence of strong electronic correlation. These findings provide promising material platforms to study the role of high disorder in the origin of superconductivity in the NC MEAs-HEAs.</summary>

    <summary>  We consider the Cooper-problem on a lattice model including onsite and near-neighbor interactions. Expanding the interaction in basis functions for the irreducible representation for the point group $C_{4v}$ yields a classification of the symmetry of the Cooper-pair wave function, which we calculate in real-space. A change of symmetry upon doping, from s-wave at low filling fractions, to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ at higher filling fractions, is found. Fermi-surface details are thus important for the symmetry of the superconducting wave function. Symmetry forbids mixing of s-wave and d-wave symmetry in the Cooper-pair wavefunction on a square lattice, unless accidental degeneracies occur. This conclusion also holds for the selfconsistent treatment of the many-body problem, at the critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$, we find temperatures which are not critical points, where new superconducting channels open up in the order parameter due to bifurcations in the solutions of the nonlinear gap-equation. We calculate the free energy, entropy, coherence length, critical magnetic fields, and Ginzburg-Landau parameter $κ$. The model is of the extreme type-II variety. At the temperatures where subdominant channels condense, we find cusps in the internal energy and entropy, as well as as BCS-like discontinuities in the specific heat. The specific heat anomalies are however weaker than at the true superconducting critical point, and argued to be of a different nature.</summary>

    <title>Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25</title>

    <summary>High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.</summary>
