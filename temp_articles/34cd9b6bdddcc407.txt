    <summary>  A scheme for fast, compact, and controllable acceleration of heavy particles in vacuum has been recently proposed [F. Peano et al., New J. Phys. 10 033028 (2008)], wherein two counterpropagating laser beams with variable frequencies drive a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, leading to particle trapping and acceleration. The technique allows for fine control over the energy distribution and the total charge of the accelerated beam, to be obtained via tuning of the frequency variation. Here, the theoretical bases of the acceleration scheme are described, and the possibility of applications to ultrafast muon acceleration and to the prompt extraction of cold-muon beams is discussed.</summary>

    <summary>Muon collider is a considerable candidate of the next-generation high-energy lepton collider machine. Operating an RF cavity in a multi-Tesla magnet is a critical requirement in a muon accelerator and a cooling channel. However, the maximum RF gradient in a vacuum RF cavity is strongly limited by an external magnetic field. Dense hydrogen gas filled RF cavity has been proposed since it is functional of generating a high RF accelerating gradient in a strong magnetic field and making an ionization cooling process at the same time. A critical issue of the cavity is a beam- induced plasma that consumes a considerable amount of RF power. The gas filled RF test cell was made and measured the RF loading due to a beam-induced plasma by using an intense proton beam at Fermilab. By doping an electronegative gas in dense hydrogen, the plasma loading effect is significantly mitigated. The result shows that the cavity is functional with a muon collider beam. Recent progress is shown in this presentation.</summary>

    <title>Towards a QED-Based Vacuum Energy</title>

    <summary>  A QED-based mechanism, breaking translational invariance of the vacuum at sufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for the vacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtual vacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fields corresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_μ^{ext} (x)$, which is itself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_μ(x)$ in the presence of that $A_μ^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equation for $A_μ^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solution corresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; this solution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on the order of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble is included; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_μ$, whose magnitude is determined by a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observed acceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which the fields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysis suggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (corresponding to a "spontaneous vacuum phase change") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a "polarization of the QED vacuum" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum). Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing the possibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whose back-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. The possibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentum transfers is discussed.</summary>
