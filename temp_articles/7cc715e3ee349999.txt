    <summary>  The electron-screening acceleration of laboratory fusion reactions at astrophysical energies is an unsolved problem of great importance to astrophysics. That effect is modeled here by considering the fusion of hydrogen-like atoms whose electron probability density is used in Poisson's equation in order to derive the corresponding screened Coulomb potential energy. That way atomic excitations and deformations of the fusing atoms can be taken into account. Those potentials are then treated semiclassically in order to obtain the screening (accelerating) factor of the reaction. By means of the proposed model the effect of a superstrong magnetic field on laboratory Hydrogen fusion reactions is investigated here for the first time showing that, despite the considerable increase in the cross section of the $% dd$ reaction, the $pp$ reaction is still too slow to justify experimentation. The proposed model is finally applied on the $H^{2}(d,p) H^{3}$ fusion reaction describing satisfactorily the experimental data although some ambiguity remains regarding the molecular nature of the deuteron target. Notably, the present method gives a sufficiently high screening energy for Hydrogen fusion reactions so that the take-away energy of the spectator nucleus can also be taken into account.</summary>

    <summary>The possibility that muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion at ambient temperature takes place in deuterated metals is analyzed theoretically. It is suggested that the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt) fusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD crystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium diffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the rate of (d$μ$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the possibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point to an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the probability of $μ^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be evaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we advance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered by cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special conditions, a mW power per $μ^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent experimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in out-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation. However, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically, and an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify or invalidate this idea.</summary>

    <title>Nuclear fusion catalyzed by doubly charged scalars: Implications for energy production</title>

    <summary>A number of popular extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of doubly charged scalar particles $X^{\pm\pm}$. Such particles may be long-lived or even stable. If exist, $X^{--}$ could form atomic bound states with light nuclei and catalyze their fusion by essentially eliminating the Coulomb barrier between them. Such an $X$-catalyzed fusion ($X$CF) process does not require high temperatures or pressure and may have important applications for energy production. A similar process of muon-catalyzed fusion ($μ$CF) has been shown not to be a viable source of energy because of the sticking of negative muons to helium nuclei produced in the fusion of hydrogen isotopes, which stops the catalytic process. We analyze $X$CF in deuterium environments and show that the $X$-particles can only stick to $^6$Li nuclei, which are produced in the third-stage reactions downstream in the catalytic cycle. The corresponding sticking probability is very low, and, before getting bound to $^6$Li, each $X$-particle can catalyze $\sim 3.5\cdot 10^{9}$ fusion cycles, producing $\sim 7\cdot 10^{4}$ TeV of energy. We also discuss the ways of reactivating the $X$-particles from the Coulomb-bound (${\rm ^6Li}X$) states, which would allow re-using them in $X$CF reactions.</summary>
