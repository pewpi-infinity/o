    <summary>Central to quantum theory, the wavefunction is the complex distribution used to completely describe a quantum system. Despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via the Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through tomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way (i.e. weak measurement) so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable both to other degrees of freedom of the photon (e.g. polarization, frequency, etc.) and to other quantum systems (e.g. electron spin-z quantum state, SQUIDs, trapped ions, etc.). Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations. We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems scientists are able to characterize and initiate new avenues to understand fundamental quantum theory.</summary>

    <summary>  Realistic quantum mechanics based on complex probability theory is shown to have a frequency interpretation, to coexist with Bell's theorem, to be linear, to include wavefunctions which are expansions in eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators and to describe both pure and mixed systems. Illustrative examples are given. The quantum version of Bayesian inference is discussed. Postscript version of hep-th/9307019.</summary>

    <title>Resonant tunneling of deuteron-triton fusion in strong high-frequency electromagnetic fields</title>

    <summary>We investigate deuteron-triton (DT) fusion in the presence of linearly polarized strong electromagnetic fields in high-frequency limit, in which a complex spherical square-well potential is exploited to describe the nuclear potential. Within the framework of the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation, we have calculated the total and angular differential fusion cross sections by investigating the asymptotical phase shifts of the Coulomb wavefunctions. With introducing a dimensionless quantity of $n_d$ representing the ratio of the particle quiver oscillation amplitude to the radius of nuclear potential, we find that, even though the tunneling probability of passing through the Coulomb repulsive potential keeps almost identical to that in the absence of electromagnetic fields, the peak of total fusion sections shows an apparent shift from the well known value of 110 keV to 78 keV for $n_d=0.01$. The angular differential cross sections also show some resonance peaks that shift from zero inclination angle to $π/2$ with increasing the parameter $n_d$. The corresponding astrophysical $S$-factors are found to be enhanced by several times in amplitudes. With the help of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximate wavefunctions, the shape-resonance tunneling mechanism of the above findings are uncovered and some implications are discussed.</summary>
