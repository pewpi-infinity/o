    <summary>The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.</summary>

    <summary>Use of lithium as a surface coating in fusion devices improves plasma performance, but the change in wall properties affects the secondary electron emission properties of the material. Lithium oxidizes easily, which drives the emission yield well above unity. We present here simulations demonstrating the change in sheath structure from monotonic to the nonmonotonic space-charge limited sheath using an energy-dependent data-driven emission model which self-consistently captures both secondary emission and backscattering populations. Increased secondary electron emission from the material has ramifications for the degradation and erosion of the wall. Results shows that the oxidation leads to an increased electron flux into the wall, and a reduced ion flux. The net transfer of energy to the surface is significantly greater for the oxidized case than for the pure lithium case. High reflection rates of low-energy backscattered particles leads to a high re-emission rate at the wall.</summary>

    <title>Irradiation of TiBe12 and CrBe12 with He+ ions and ex-situ transmission electron microscopy to investigate ion damage as a proxy for neutron irradiation damage in nuclear fusion</title>

    <summary>Ti and Cr beryllides are materials of potential importance as neutron multipliers for tritium breeding in nuclear fusion reactors. The n-to-2n transmutation reaction also produces tritium and helium, which form bubbles. Neutron irradiation from fusion plasma also introduces point defects. The effect on beryllides' microstructure is important for understanding their mechanical properties and evolution in the fusion reactor environment. This study determines and describes the microstructural features that occur in TiBe12 and CrBe12 when He and fast-particle-induced point defects are introduced at fusion reactor neutron breeder relevant temperatures. Beryllide samples were implanted with 300kV He at temperatures between $387-900^{\circ}C$, sectioned down through the implantation surface with a focused ion beam post-irradiation, and the resulting microstructures examined using transmission electron microscopy, electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and precession diffraction mapping. Nanometre bubbles grew in both TiBe12 and CrBe12 at $600^{\circ}C$; larger (100 nm and over) bubbles, some faceted, grew at $900^{\circ}C$. Some bubbles in CrBe12 were lined with Cr, some oxidised. TiBe12 developed planar faults, on $\{110\}$ planes at $600^{\circ}C$ and below but on $\{111\}$ at $900^{\circ}C$. Faults were preferentially associated with large bubbles. The displacement vectors of faults on the $\{110\}$ planes had some commonality with previous studies that found displacement vectors of families $R=\langle 011\rangle$ and $R= \langle 110\rangle$; the present study also found faults that matched neither previously found type. CrBe12 also developed planar faults with an appearance quite different from the typical striped appearance of planar stacking faults; their nature remains unknown. Oxide particles were found in both beryllides, most prominently in CrBe12.</summary>
