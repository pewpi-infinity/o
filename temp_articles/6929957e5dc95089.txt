    <summary>  This report is a self-contained and comprehensive review of the physics of propagating pulses of high-intensity high-energy particle beams in pre-existing or self-generated plasmas. Consideration is given to beams of electrons, protons, muons, and their antiparticles, as well as to neutral-hydrogen, positronium, and electron-positron-plasmoid beams. The first part is a systematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation, plasma self-generation, energy/current-losses, and stability of such pulses. The second part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have been carried out, in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas, to assess the validity of theoretical models. It is found that the data available on these experiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with theory. In particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current charged-particle beams in the atmosphere is possible over distances equal to several Nordsieck lengths. In order not to be deflected by Earth's magnetic field, electron-beam pulses need to be guided by a pre-formed channel, while proton-beam pulses may under suitable conditions propagate undeflected through both the low- and high-atmosphere. In ionospheric or outer-space plasmas, very-long-range propagation across Earth's magnetic field requires GeV to TeV electrons or positron beams in order for the transverse deflection to be acceptable, while undeflected propagation is possible for plasmoid beams consisting of co-moving high-energy particle pairs such as electrons and positrons.</summary>

    <summary>Processes occurring in a radio-frequency (rf) cavity, filled with high pressure gas and interacting with proton beams, have been studied via advanced numerical simulations. Simulations support the experimental program on the hydrogen gas-filled rf cavity in the Mucool Test Area (MTA) at Fermilab, and broader research on the design of muon cooling devices. SPACE, a 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code with atomic physics support, was used in simulation studies. Plasma dynamics in the rf cavity, including the process of neutral gas ionization by proton beams, plasma loading of the rf cavity, and atomic processes in plasma such as electron-ion and ion-ion recombination and electron attachment to dopant molecules, have been studied. Through comparison with experiments in the MTA, simulations quantified several uncertain values of plasma properties such as effective recombination rates and the attachment time of electrons to dopant molecules. Simulations have achieved very good agreement with experiments on plasma loading and related processes. The experimentally validated code SPACE is capable of predictive simulations of muon cooling devices.</summary>

    <summary>Muon beam-induced plasma loading of radio-frequency (RF) cavities filled with high pressure hydrogen gas with 1% dry air dopant has been studied via numerical simulations. The electromagnetic code SPACE, that resolves relevant atomic physics processes, including ionization by the muon beam, electron attachment to dopant molecules, and electron-ion and ion-ion recombination, has been used. Simulations studies have been performed in the range of parameters typical for practical muon cooling channels.</summary>
