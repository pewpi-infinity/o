    <summary>Magnesium and its alloys are the most investigated materials for solid-state hydrogen storage in the form of metal hydrides, but there are still unresolved problems with the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of this group of materials. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP), high-pressure torsion (HPT), intensive rolling and fast forging, have been widely used to enhance the activation, air resistance, and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics of Mg-based hydrogen storage materials by introducing ultrafine/nanoscale grains and crystal lattice defects. These severely deformed materials, particularly in the presence of alloying additives or second-phase nanoparticles, can show not only fast hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics but also good cycling stability. It was shown that some materials that are apparently inert to hydrogen can absorb hydrogen after SPD processing. Moreover, the SPD methods were effectively used for hydrogen binding-energy engineering and synthesizing new magnesium alloys with low thermodynamic stability for reversible low/room-temperature hydrogen storage, such as nanoglasses, high-entropy alloys, and metastable phases including the high-pressure γ-MgH2 polymorph. This article reviews recent advances in the development of Mg-based hydrogen storage materials by SPD processing and discusses their potential in future applications.</summary>

    <title>Molecular origins of colossal barocaloric effects in plastic crystals</title>

    <summary>In recent years, orientationally disordered crystals, or plastic crystals, have transformed the field of solid-state cooling due to the significant latent heat and entropy changes associated with their temperature induced molecular order-disorder phase transition, which can produce colossal caloric effects under external field stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these huge caloric effects remain inadequately understood, and general principles for enhancing the performance of caloric plastic crystals are lacking. Previous studies have predominantly focused on molecular rotations, overlooking other potentially critical factors, such as lattice vibrations and molecular conformations. In this study, we employ classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to both replicate and elucidate the microscopic origins of the experimentally observed colossal barocaloric (BC) effects -- those driven by hydrostatic pressure -- in the archetypal plastic crystal neopentyl glycol (NPG). Our MD simulations demonstrate that in NPG, the combined BC response and phase-transition entropy changes arising from lattice vibrations and molecular conformations are nearly equal to those from molecular reorientations, contributing 45% and 55%, respectively. These findings suggest that, alongside hydrogen bonding -- which directly impacts molecular rotational dynamics -- lattice vibrational and molecular structural features, often overlooked, must be integrated into the rational design and modeling of advanced caloric plastic crystals. These insights are not only of significant fundamental interest but also essential for driving the development of next-generation solid-state refrigeration technologies.</summary>

    <title>Matchings and entropies of cylinders</title>

    <summary>  The enumeration of perfect matchings of graphs is equivalent to the dimer problem which has applications in statistical physics. A graph $G$ is said to be $n$-rotation symmetric if the cyclic group of order $n$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of $G$. Jockusch (Perfect matchings and perfect squares, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 67(1994), 100-115) and Kuperberg (An exploration of the permanent-determinant method, Electron. J. Combin., 5(1998), #46) proved independently that if $G$ is a plane bipartite graph of order $N$ with $2n$-rotation symmetry, then the number of perfect matchings of $G$ can be expressed as the product of $n$ determinants of order $N/2n$. In this paper we give this result a new presentation. We use this result to compute the entropy of a bulk plane bipartite lattice with $2n$-notation symmetry. We obtain explicit expressions for the numbers of perfect matchings and entropies for two types of cylinders. Using the results on the entropy of the torus obtained by Kenyon, Okounkov, and Sheffield (Dimers and amoebae, Ann. Math. 163(2006), 1019--1056) and by Salinas and Nagle (Theory of the phase transition in the layered hydrogen-bonded $SnCl^2\cdot 2H_2O$ crystal, Phys. Rev. B, 9(1974), 4920--4931), we show that each of the cylinders considered and its corresponding torus have the same entropy. Finally, we pose some problems.</summary>
