    <title>Metallic liquid hydrogen and likely Al2O3 metallic glass</title>

    <summary>Dynamic compression has been used to synthesize liquid metallic hydrogen at 140 GPa (1.4 million bar) and experimental data and theory predict Al2O3 might be a metallic glass at ~300 GPa. The mechanism of metallization in both cases is probably a Mott-like transition. The strength of sapphire causes shock dissipation to be split differently in the strong solid and soft fluid. Once the 4.5-eV H-H and Al-O bonds are broken at sufficiently high pressures in liquid H2 and in sapphire (single-crystal Al2O3), electrons are delocalized, which leads to formation of energy bands in fluid H and probably in amorphous Al2O3. The high strength of sapphire causes shock dissipation to be absorbed primarily in entropy up to ~400 GPa, which also causes the 300-K isotherm and Hugoniot to be virtually coincident in this pressure range. Above ~400 GPa shock dissipation must go primarily into temperature, which is observed experimentally as a rapid increase in shock pressure above ~400 GPa. The metallization of glassy Al2O3, if verified, is expected to be general in strong oxide insulators. Implications for Super Earths are discussed.</summary>

    <title>Graphene on Insulating Oxide Substrates: Role of Surface Dangling States</title>

    <summary>  We study the effect of insulating oxide substrates on the energy band structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene using a first principles density functional based electronic structure method and a local exchange correlation approximation. We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz) and Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We focus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in perturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface terminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated quartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large equilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface terminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top surface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with the Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second carbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface layers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with both surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers. By passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top layer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the Fermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important role than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the linear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms ripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found to be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.</summary>

    <summary>  Copper nanoparticles have been grown in silica matrix by annealing of the sol-gel prepared porous matrix impregnated with the copper nitrate. The annealing has been performed in air, successively in air and hydrogen, and in hydrogen. Cu nanoparticles in size range of 2-65 nm have been grown depending on annealing conditions. Annealing in air results in copper oxide nanoparticles (Cu2O) growth as well. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical spectroscopy of the copper nanoparticles in silica matrix have been performed. The copper nanoparticles of two types are grown: spherical mature particles and elliptical seed particles. The surface plasmon peak has been observed clearly in absorption spectra of Cu nanoparticles. Surface plasmon peak in absorption spectra of Cu nanoparticles demonstrates slight blue shift with decrease of the particle size. The half-width of the surface plasmon peak decreases appreciably at the lowering of temperature from 293 K to 77 and 4.2K that is due to strong electron-phonon interaction. The low-frequency Raman scattering data are in agreement with electron microscopy and absorption data. Photoluminescence from the copper nanoparticles has been observed. Efficiency of the luminescence increases appreciably at the decrease of particle size. The observed increase is explained, probably, by the coupling of the excited incoming and outgoing emitted photons with surface plasmon.</summary>
