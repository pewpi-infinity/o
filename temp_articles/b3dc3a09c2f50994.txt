    <summary>We propose the platform of a Yang-Lee anyon system which is constructed from Majorana bound states in topological superconductors. Yang-Lee anyons, described by the non-unitary conformal field theory with the central charge $c=-22/5$, are non-unitary counterparts of Fibonacci anyons, obeying the same fusion rule, but exhibiting non-unitary non-Abelian braiding statistics. We consider a topological superconductor junction system coupled with dissipative electron baths, which realizes a non-Hermitian interacting Majorana system. Numerically estimating the central charge, we examine the condition that the non-Hermitian Majorana system can simulate the Ising spin model of the Yang-Lee edge singularity, and confirm that, by controlling model parameters in a feasible way, the Yang-Lee edge criticality is realized. On the basis of this scenario, we present the scheme for the fusion, measurement and braiding of Yang-Lee anyons in our proposed setup.</summary>

    <summary>The design of electromagnetic coils may require evaluation of several quantities that are challenging to compute numerically. These quantities include Lorentz forces, which may be a limiting factor due to stresses; the internal magnetic field, which is relevant for determining stress as well as a superconducting coil's proximity to its quench limit; and the inductance, which determines stored magnetic energy and dynamics. When computing the effect on one coil due to the current in another, these quantities can often be approximated quickly by treating the coils as infinitesimally thin. When computing the effect on a coil due to its own current (e.g., self-force or self-inductance), evaluation is difficult due to the presence of a singularity; coils cannot be treated as infinitesimally thin as each quantity diverges at zero conductor width. Here, we present novel and well-behaved methods for evaluating these quantities using non-singular integral formulae of reduced dimensions. These formulae are determined rigorously by dividing the domain of integration of the magnetic vector potential into two regions, exploiting appropriate approximations in each region, and expanding in high aspect ratio. Our formulae show good agreement to full finite-thickness calculations even at low aspect ratio, both analytically for a torus and numerically for a non-planar coil of a stellarator fusion device, the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX). Because the integrands of these formulae develop fine structure as the minor radius becomes infinitely thin, we also develop a method of evaluating the self-force and self-inductance with even greater efficiency by integrating this sharp feature analytically. We demonstrate with this method that the self-force can be accurately computed for the HSX coil with as few as 12 grid points.</summary>

    <summary>We study the interlayer pairing states in layered systems of two different 2d electronic subsystems, one with relativistic linear and the other with non-relativistic parabolic spectrum. The complex order parameter of the paired state has a two component structure. We investigate the pairing state formation on the mean-field level, determine the critical interaction strength and evaluate the effective potential. The anisotropic three-band spectrum of quasiparticles depends explicitly on the phase difference of the order parameter components, rotates in momentum space as it changes. It is subject to the strong band deformation due to the pairing. It leads to the fusion and hybridization of initially decoupled bands. The quasiparticle spectrum has the shape of deformed Dirac cones in the vicinity of the two touching points between neighboring bands. The density of states exhibits a number of specific features due to band deformation, such as a van Hove singularity.</summary>
