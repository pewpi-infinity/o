    <summary>  We study the quantum Hall effect in graphene at filling factors ν= 0 and ν= \pm, concentrating on the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime, within a non-perturbative bosonization formalism. We start by developing a bosonization scheme for electrons with two discrete degrees of freedom (spin-1/2 and pseudospin-1/2) restricted to the lowest Landau level. Three distinct phases are considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin phases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (ν=-1) while the others to a half-filled (ν= 0) lowest Landau level. In each case, we show that the elementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set of n-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of the projected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospin density operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to the effective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms, recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, an effective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations of the elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that the charged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherent state of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson model derived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian and show that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantum Hall skyrmions. We briefly discuss the influence of the SU(4) symmetry breaking terms in the skyrmion energy.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Gates Between Distant Qubits via Spin-Independent Scattering</title>

    <summary>We show how the spin independent scattering of two initially distant qubits, say, in distinct traps or in remote sites of a lattice, can be used to implement an entangling quantum gate between them. The scattering takes place under 1D confinement for which we consider two different scenarios: a 1D wave-guide and a tight-binding lattice. We consider models with contact-like interaction between two fermionic or two bosonic particles. A qubit is encoded in two distinct spins (or other internal) states of each particle. Our scheme enables the implementation of a gate between two qubits which are initially too far to interact directly, and provides an alternative to photonic mediators for the scaling of quantum computers. Fundamentally, an interesting feature is that "identical particles" (e.g., two atoms of the same species) and the 1D confinement, are both necessary for the action of the gate. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our scheme, the degree of control required to initialize the wave-packets momenta, and show how the quality of the gate is affected by momentum distributions and initial distance. In a lattice, the control of quasi-momenta is naturally provided by few local edge impurities in the lattice potential.</summary>

    <title>Dynamics of the spin-boson model with a structured environment</title>

    <summary>  We investigate the dynamics of the spin-boson model when the spectral density of the boson bath shows a resonance at a characteristic frequency $Ω$ but behaves Ohmically at small frequencies. The time evolution of an initial state is determined by making use of the mapping onto a system composed of a quantum mechanical two-state system (TSS) which is coupled to a harmonic oscillator (HO) with frequency $Ω$. The HO itself is coupled to an Ohmic environment. The dynamics is calculated by employing the numerically exact quasiadiabatic path-integral propagator technique. We find significant new properties compared to the Ohmic spin-boson model. By reducing the TSS-HO system in the dressed states picture to a three-level system for the special case at resonance, we calculate the dephasing rates for the TSS analytically. Finally, we apply our model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to an underdamped dc-SQUID detector.</summary>
