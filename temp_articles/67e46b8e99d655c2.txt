    <summary>  Graphene - a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagonal lattice - has one of the strongest possible atomic bonds and can be viewed as a robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups. Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and, essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains the hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties.</summary>

    <summary>  Defects change essentially not only electronic but also chemical properties of graphene being centers of its chemical activity. Their functionalization is a way to modify electronic and crystal structure of graphene which may be important for graphene-based nanoelectronics. Using hydrogen as an example, we have simulated a chemistry of imperfect graphene for a broad class of defects (Stone-Wales defects, bivacancy, nitrogen substitution impurity, and zigzag edges) by density functional calculations. We have studied also an effect of finite width of graphene nanoribbons on their chemical properties. It is shown that magnetism at graphene edges is fragile with respect to oxidation and, therefore, a chemical protection of the graphene edges may be required for application of graphene in spintronics. At the same time, hydrogenation of the Stone-Wales defects may be a perspective way to create magnetic carbon.</summary>

    <title>Seeding ice growth at ambient conditions using nano graphene oxide</title>

    <summary>Water wetting on a hydrophobic surface at ambient conditions is disallowed by the nonpolar nature of the surface and high vapor pressure of water. However, the presence of sub-millimeter sized hydrophilic patches allows the waxy wings of desert beetles to become wettable by morning mist. Here, we show that a sprinkle of graphene oxide nanoflakes (nanoGOs) is effective in condensing water nanodroplets and seeding ice epitaxy on graphite at ambient conditions. By controlling relative humidity and nanoGO density, we are able to study the formation of a complete ice wetting layer on a time scale of 20 hours. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to visualize ice nucleation and growth in real time using non-contact atomic force microscopy. The stages of crystallization, as proposed by Ostwald in 1897, is fully unfolded at a microscopic level for the first time. We obtain real-time imaging of sequential phase transition from amorphous ice to a transient cubic ice Ic stage and finally to the stable hexagonal ice Ih. Most interestingly, we discover that ice nucleation and growth can be influenced by modifying the functional groups of nanoGO, and by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding between nanoGOs. This affords a strategy to control heterogenous ice nucleation and snow crystal formation.</summary>
