    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>

    <summary>The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates was possible only through an intimate knowledge of perovskite oxides which have been synthesized and characterized for decades at the IBM in the Zürich laboratoty. Especially SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 have been in the focus at IBM as was presented in Volume 1 of a series [1]. Probably for the first time detailed microscopic investigations of the local properties of these compounds have been obtained by studying by means of EPR the surroundings of transition metal impurities in these materials. These experiments enabled the identification of the order parameter of the structural instability observed in these oxides. However, the idea to search for superconductivity came later motivated by theoretical considerations that metallic hydrogen could become superconducting at high temperatures. Since SrTiO3 is an insulator it was thought that the implantation of hydrogen would render it metallic and eventually also superconducting. This approach failed since the carrier density remained always too small. In sequence it was then tried to achieve a metallic state in oxide perovskites by varying their composition which was in so far promising as reduced SrTiO3 exhibits superconductivity at 0.3K [2]. Furthermore it was subsequently shown [3] that Tc can be enhanced to 1.2K by doping SrTiO3 with Nb. In spite of the fact that Tc was far below values achieved in A15 compounds, a remarkable observation was connected with the Nb doped perovskite, namely for the first time long before predicted two-gap superconductivity was realized here.</summary>

    <title>New quantum state formed by highly concentrated protons in superconducting palladium hydride</title>

    <summary>Hydrogen exhibits quantum phenomena, such as tunneling in materials. According to theory, the quantum properties of hydrogen change significantly in superconductors due to the emergence of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which reduces the interaction between hydrogen nucleus (i.e., proton) and conduction electrons. This reduction is predicted to enhance the tunneling probability of protons. Here, we report the double transitions of the electrical resistivity in high-quality palladium hydride (PdHx) and deuteride (PdDx) prepared by low-temperature absorption below T = 180 K. After a sharp drop in the resistivity at T ~ 2 K owing to the superconducting transition of PdH(D)x, a large residual resistivity remained. Additionally, the resistivity dropped to zero below T = 1 K. The experimental results suggest that the quantum tunneling of highly concentrated protons (deuterons) in the superconducting state is responsible for the observed features: the residual resistivity arises from the weakening of the global coherence of superconductivity owing to the tunneling motion of protons (deuterons), while the zero resistivity is caused by long-range ordering of the protons (deuterons). This system offers a new platform for investigating the quantum many-body properties of tunneling particles.</summary>
