    <summary>We study fluctuation properties in the energy spectra of finite-size honeycomb lattices, graphene billiards, subject to the Haldane-model onsite potential and next-nearest neighbor interaction at critical points, referred to as Haldane graphene billiards in the following. The billiards had the shapes of a rectangular billiard with integrable dynamics, one with chaotic dynamics, and one whose shape has, in addition, threefold rotational symmetry. It had been shown that the spectral properties of the graphene billiards coincide with those of the nonrelativistic quantum billiard with the corresponding shape, both at the band edges and in the region of low energy excitations around the Dirac points at zero energy. There, the dispersion relation is linear and, accordingly, the spectrum is described by the same relativistic Dirac equation for massless half-spin particles as relativistic neutrino billiards, whose spectral properties agree with those of nonrelativistic quantum billiards with violated time-reversal invariance. Deviations from the expected behavior are attributed to differing boundary conditions and backscattering at the boundary, which leads to a mixing of valley states corresponding to the two Dirac points, that are mapped into each other through time reversal. We employ a Haldane model to introduce a gap at one of the two Dirac points so that backscattering is suppressed in the energy region of the gap and demonstrate that there the correlations in the spectra comply with those of the neutrino billiard of the corresponding shape.</summary>

    <summary>  We report on transport characteristics of quantum dot devices etched entirely in graphene. At large sizes, they behave as conventional single-electron transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots smaller than 100 nm, the peaks become strongly non-periodic indicating a major contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino (Dirac) billiards. Short constrictions of only a few nm in width remain conductive and reveal a confinement gap of up to 0.5eV, which demonstrates the in-principle possibility of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Induced Broadening- A Challenge For Cosmic Neutrino Background Discovery</title>

    <summary>A recent preprint by Cheipesh {\it et al.} pointed out that the zero-point motion of Tritium atoms bound to Graphene may blur the measured energies of $β$ electrons. Smearing due to zero point motion is well known. Such an effect features in studies of the $β$ spectrum expected in experiments like KATRIN using diatomic Tritium. The recent preprint may, however, challenge new planned experiments seeking to discover the Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) neutrinos (and/or other neutrinos of masses smaller than $0.1$ eV) which plan to use Tritium adsorbed onto Graphene or other materials. Our paper clarifies these issues and examines the more general problem of smearing induced by quantum uncertainty. We find that the effect of Cheipesh {\it et al.} is reduced considerably. The importance of the chemical evolution of the $^{3}$H atom hosting the Tritium nucleus into a tightly bound neutral $^{3}$He atom is emphasized. We estimate the excess blurring caused by the dense spectrum near the lowest state of the Graphene or other hosts of the Tritium atom, generated by the electronic response to the "sudden" escape of the $β$ electron. Our analysis suggests yet larger effects and difficulties facing many experiments searching for small mass neutrinos. We speculate on a possible experimental setup which could minimize quantum broadening.</summary>
