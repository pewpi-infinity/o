    <summary>Recently a lot of progress has been made in deriving the heavy quark potential within a QCD medium. In this article we have considered heavy quarkonium in a hot quark gluon plasma phase. The heavy-quark potential has been modeled properly for short as well as long distances. The potential at long distances is modeled as a QCD string which is screened at the same scale as the Coloumb field. We have numerically solved the 1+1-dimensional Schrodinger equation for this potential and obtained the eigen wavefunction and binding energy for the $1S$ and $2S$ states of charmonium and bottomonium. Further, we have calculated the decay width and dissociation temperature of quarkonium states in the QCD plasma. Finally, we have used our recently proposed unified model with these new values of decay widths to calculate the survival probability of the various quarkonium states with respect to centrality at relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) and large hadron collider (LHC) energies. This study provides a unified, consistent and comprehensive description of spectroscopic properties of various quarkonium states at finite temperatures along with their nuclear modification factor at different collision energies.</summary>

    <summary>  We calculate the lowest order charm and beauty parton distribution functions in and fragmentation functions into D and B mesons using the operator definitions of factorized perturbative QCD. In the vacuum, we find the leading corrections that arise from the structure of the final-state hadrons. Quark-antiquark potentials extracted from the lattice are employed to demonstrate the existence of open heavy flavor bound-state solutions in the QGP in the vicinity of the critical temperature. We provide first results for the in-medium modification of the heavy quark distribution and decay probabilities in a co-moving plasma. In an improved perturbative QCD description of heavy flavor dynamics in the thermal medium, we combine D and B meson formation and dissociation with parton-level charm and beauty quark quenching to obtain predictions for the heavy meson and non-photonic electron suppression in Cu+Cu and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively.</summary>

    <summary>Modification of nuclear reactions due to impurities in plasma is investigated. The hindering effect of Coulomb repulsion between reacting particles, that is effective in direct reactions, can practically disappear if Coulomb interaction of the reacting particles with impurities embedded in plasma is taken into account. The change of the wavefunction of reacting particles in nuclear range due to their Coulomb interaction with impurity is determined using standard time independent perturbation calculation of quantum mechanics. The result can be interpreted as if a slow, quasi-free particle (e.g. a proton) were pushed by a heavy, assisting particle (impurity) of the surroundings and can get (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum which significantly increases the nuclear contact probability density and also the probability of its capture by an other nucleus. As a sample reaction the process, called impurity assisted nuclear $% pd$ reaction is investigated and the rate and power densities produced by the reaction are numerically calculated. With the aid of astrophysical factors the rate and power densities of the impurity assisted $% d(d,n)_{2}^{3}He$, $d(d,p)t$, $d(t,n)_{2}^{4}He$, $_{2}^{3}He(d,p)_{2}^{4}He$% , $_{3}^{6}Li(p,α)_{2}^{3}He$, $_{3}^{7}Li(p,α)_{2}^{4}He$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(p,α)_{3}^{6}Li$, $_{4}^{9}Be(p,d)_{4}^{8}Be$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(α,n)_{6}^{12}C$, $_{5}^{10}B(p,α)_{4}^{7}Be$ and $%_{5}^{11}B(p,α)_{4}^{8}Be$ reactions are also estimated. The affect of plasma-wall interaction on the process is also considered. A partial survey of impurity assisted nuclear reactions which may have practical importance in energy production is also presented.</summary>
