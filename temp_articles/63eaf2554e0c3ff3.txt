    <summary>Within the subgap of amorphous oxide semiconductors like amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) are donor-like and acceptor-like states that control the operational physics of optically transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs). Hydrogen incorporation into the channel layer of a top-gate a-IGZO TFT exists as an electron donor that causes an observed negative shift in the drain current-gate voltage ($\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$) transfer curve turn-on voltage. Normally, hydrogen is thought to create shallow electronic states just below the conduction band mobility edge, with the donor ionization state controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics involving the position of the Fermi level with respect to the donor ionization energy. However, hydrogen does not behave as a normal donor as revealed by the subgap density of states (DoS) measured by the photoconduction response of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs to within 0.3 eV of the CBM edge. Specifically, the DoS shows a subgap peak above the valence band mobility edge growing at the same rate that $\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$ transfer curve measurements suggest that hydrogen was incorporated into the channel layer. Such hydrogen donor behavior in a-IGZO is anomalous and can be understood as follows: Non-bonded hydrogen ionization precedes its incorporation into the a-IGZO network as a bonded species. Ionized hydrogen bonds to a charged oxygen-on-an-oxygen-site anion, resulting in the formation of a defect complex denoted herein as, $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$. Formation of an $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$ defect complex creates a spectrally-broad ($\sim$0.3 eV FWHM) distribution of electronic states observed in the bandgap centered at 0.4 eV above the valence band mobility edge.</summary>

    <title>Mixed atomic-scale electronic configuration as a strategy to avoid cocatalyst utilization in photocatalysis by high-entropy oxides</title>

    <summary>To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.</summary>

    <title>Investigation of a high-entropy oxide photocatalyst for hydrogen generation by first-principles calculations coupled with experiments: Significance of electronegativity</title>

    <summary>High-entropy oxides (HEOs), containing at least five principal cations, have recently emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Despite their high potential, the impact of the cation mixtures on photocatalytic activity remains poorly understood. This study investigates the high-entropy photocatalyst TiZrHfNbTaO11 using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods to elucidate the effects of various elements on electronic structure and water splitting performance. The results indicate that the HEO exhibits a bandgap comparable to TiO2 polymorphs rutile, brookite and anatase. Cations with lower electronegativity, such as hafnium and zirconium, provide the strongest water adsorption energy, serving as active sites for water adsorption. Additionally, the co-presence of highly electronegative cations like niobium and tantalum adjacent to hafnium and zirconium enhances charge transfer to water molecules, improving splitting efficiency. These findings suggest novel strategies for designing high-entropy photocatalysts by synergistic incorporating cations with different electronegativities.</summary>
