    <summary>We present a theoretical study of the effects of heterostrain and lattice relaxation on the optical conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle, based on the band structures obtained from a continuum model. We find that heterostrain, lattice relaxation and their combination give rise to very distinctive spectroscopic features in the optical conductivity, which can be used to probe and distinguish these effects. From the spectrum at various Fermi energies, important features in the strain- and relaxation-modified band structure such as the bandgap, bandwidth and van Hove singularities can be directly measured. The peak associated with the transition between the flat bands in the optical conductivity are highly sensitive to the direction of the strain, which can provide direct information on the strain-modified flat bands.</summary>

    <summary>The discovery of a new type of solitons occuring in periodic systems without photonic bandgaps is reported. Solitons are nonlinear self-trapped wave packets. They have been extensively studied in many branches of physics. Solitons in periodic systems, which have become the mainstream of soliton research in the past decade, are localized states supported by photonic bandgaps. In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new type of solitons located at the Dirac point beyond photonic bandgaps. The Dirac point is a conical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys the famous Dirac equation. These new solitons are sustained by the Dirac point rather than photonic bandgaps, thus provides a sort of advance in conceptual understanding over the traditional gap solitons. Apart from their theoretical impact within soliton theory, they have many potential uses because such solitons have dramatic stability characteristics and are possible in both Kerr material and photorefractive crystals that possess self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. The new results elegantly reveal that traditional photonic bandgaps are not required when Dirac points are accessible. The findings enrich the soliton family and provide valuable information for studies of nonlinear waves in many branches of physics, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and Bose Einstein condensates.</summary>

    <title>Crystalline Soda Can Metamaterial exhibiting Graphene-like Dispersion at subwavelength scale</title>

    <summary>Graphene, a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms ruled by tight-binding interaction, exhibits extraordinary electronic properties due to the presence of Dirac cones within its band structure. These intriguing singularities have naturally motivated the discovery of their classical analogues. In this work, we present a general and direct procedure to reproduce the peculiar physics of graphene within a very simple acoustic metamaterial: a double lattice of soda cans resonant at two different frequencies. The first triangular sub-lattice generates a bandgap at low frequency, which induces a tight-binding coupling between the resonant defects of the second Honeycomb one, hence allowing us to obtain a graphene-like band structure. We prove the relevance of this approach by showing that both numerical and experimental dispersion relations exhibit the requested Dirac cone. We also demonstrate the straightforward monitoring of the coupling strength within the crystal of resonant defects. This work shows that crystalline metamaterials are very promising candidates to investigate tantalizing solid-state physics phenomena with classical waves.</summary>
