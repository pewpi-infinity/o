    <summary>The ground-state properties of one-dimensional electron-spin-polarized hydrogen $^1$H, deuterium $^2$H, and tritium $^3$H are obtained by means of quantum Monte Carlo methods. The equations of state of the three isotopes are calculated for a wide range of linear densities. The pair correlation function and the static structure factor are obtained and interpreted within the framework of the Luttinger liquid theory. We report the density dependence of the Luttinger parameter and use it to identify different physical regimes: Bogoliubov Bose gas, super-Tonks-Girardeau gas, and quasi-crystal regimes for bosons; repulsive, attractive Fermi gas, and quasi-crystal regimes for fermions. We find that the tritium isotope is the one with the richest behaviour. Our results show unambiguously the relevant role of the isotope mass in the properties of this quantum system.</summary>

    <summary>  This conference talk elaborates on a recently discovered mapping procedure by which classical orbits and path integrals for the motion of a point particle in flat space can be transformed correctly into those in curved space. This procedure evolved from well established methods in the theory of plastic deformations where crystals with defects are described mathematically by applying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the context of time-sliced path integrals, there seems to exists a quantum equivalence principle which determines the measures of fluctating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations produce a nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which in a curved space produces
 an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's time-sliced path integral. This cancelation is important in correctly describing semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensible for the process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed in terms of Bose fields.</summary>

    <summary>  A simple mapping procedure is presented by which classical orbits and path integrals for the motion of a point particle in flat space can be transformed directly into those in curved space with torsion. Our procedure evolved from well-established methods in the theory of plastic deformations, where crystals with defects are described mathematically as images of ideal crystals under active nonholonomic coordinate transformations.
  Our mapping procedure may be viewed as a natural extension of Einstein's famous equivalence principle. When applied to time-sliced path integrals, it gives rise to a new "quantum equivalence principle" which determines short-time action and measure of fluctuating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations possesses a nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which produces in a curved space an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar R, thus canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt. This cancelation is important for correctly describing semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensable for the process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed by those fields.</summary>
