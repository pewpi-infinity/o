    <summary>We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.</summary>

    <title>Momentum-space Gravity from the Quantum Geometry and Entropy of Bloch Electrons</title>

    <summary>Quantum geometry is a key quantity that distinguishes electrons in a crystal from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However, unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moiré systems with flat bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field equations remains sourceless for pure states while for mixed states it acquires a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy, for small entropies. We compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general relativity and conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force. Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space gravity and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual gravity in quantum materials.</summary>

    <title>Casimir and Casimir-Polder Forces in Graphene Systems: Quantum Field Theoretical Description and Thermodynamics</title>

    <summary>We review recent results on the low-temperature behaviors of the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy an entropy for a polarizable atom interacting with a graphene sheet and for two graphene sheets, respectively. These results are discussed in the wide context of problems arising in the Lifshitz theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces when it is applied to metallic and dielectric bodies. After a brief treatment of different approaches to theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of graphene, we concentrate on the derivation of response function in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in the Matsubara formulation using the polarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The asymptotic expressions for the Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy and entropy at low temperature, obtained with the polarization tensor, are presented for a pristine graphene as well as for graphene sheets possessing some nonzero energy gap $Δ$ and chemical potential $μ$ under different relationships between the values of $Δ$ and $μ$. Along with reviewing the results obtained in the literature, we present some new findings concerning the case of zero gap and nonzero chemical potential. The conclusion is made that the Lifshitz theory of the Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces in graphene systems using the quantum field theoretical description of a pristine graphene, as well as real graphene sheets with $Δ&gt;2μ$ or $Δ&lt;2μ$, is consistent with the requirements of thermodynamics. The case of graphene with $Δ=2μ\neq 0$ leads to an entropic anomaly, but is argued to be physically unrealistic. The way to a resolution of thermodynamic problems in the Lifshitz theory based on the results obtained for graphene is discussed.</summary>
