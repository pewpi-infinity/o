    <summary>Wave-particle interaction (WPI) is one of the most fundamental processes in plasma physics in which one most prominent example is the Landau damping. Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.</summary>

    <title>Effect of resonant magnetic perturbations with toroidal mode numbers of 4 and 6 on ELMs in single null H-mode plasmas in MAST</title>

    <summary>The application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with a toroidal mode number of n=4 or n=6 to lower single null plasmas in the MAST tokamak produces up to a factor of 5 increase in Edge Localized Mode (ELM) frequency and reduction in plasma energy loss associated with type-I ELMs. A threshold current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately linearly with current in the coils. Despite a large scan of parameters, complete ELM suppression has not been achieved. The results have been compared to modelling performed using either the vacuum approximation or including the plasma response. During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these lobes is correlated with the increase in ELM frequency observed. The characteristics of the mitigated ELMs are similar to those of the natural ELMs suggesting that they are type I ELMs which are triggered at a lower pressure gradient. The application of the RMPs in the n=4 and n=6 configurations before the L-H transition has little effect on the power required to achieve H-mode while still allowing the first ELM to be mitigated.</summary>

    <title>Quasilinear theory of Brillouin resonances in rotating magnetized plasmas</title>

    <summary>Both spin and orbital angular momentum can be exchanged between a rotating wave and a rotating magnetized plasma. Through resonances the spin and orbital angular momentum of the wave can be coupled to both the cyclotron rotation and the drift rotation of the particles. It is however shown that the Landau and cyclotron resonance conditions which classically describe resonant energy-momentum exchange between waves and particles are no longer valid in a rotating magnetized plasma column. In this case a new resonance condition which involves a resonant matching between the wave frequency, the cyclotron frequency modified by inertial effects and the harmonics of the guiding center rotation is identified. A new quasilinear equation describing orbital and spin angular momentum exchanges through these new Brillouin resonances is then derived, and used to expose the wave driven radial current responsible for angular momentum absorption.</summary>
