    <summary>  Assuming three flavour neutrino mixing takes place in vacuum, we investigate the possibility that the solar $ν_e$ take part in MSW transitions in the Sun due to $Δm^2_{31} \sim (10^{-7} - 10^{-4})~eV^2$, followed by long wave length vacuum oscillations on the way to the Earth, triggered by $Δm^2_{21}$ (or $Δm^2_{32}$) $\sim (10^{-12} - 10^{-10})~eV^2$. The solar $ν_e$ survival probability is shown to be described in this case by a simple analytic expression. New ranges of neutrino parameters which allow to fit the solar neutrino data have been found. The best fit characterized by the minimum $χ^2$ is extremely good. This hybrid (MSW+vacuum oscillations) solution of the solar neutrino problem leads to peculiar distortions of energy spectrum of the boron neutrinos which can be observed by the SuperKamiokande and SNO experiments. Other flavour scheme (e.g. 2 active $ν$s + 1 sterile $ν$) can provide MSW+vacuum solution also.</summary>

    <summary>As neutrino oscillation data becomes ever more precise, the use of approximate formulae for the oscillation probabilities ${\mathcal P}_{αβ}$ must be examined to ensure that the approximation is adequate. Here, the oscillation probability ${\mathcal P}_{ee}$ is investigated in the context of the Daya Bay experiment; the oscillation probability ${\mathcal P}_{μμ}$ is investigated in terms of the T2K disappearance experiment; and the probability ${\mathcal P}_{μe}$ is investigated in terms of the T2K appearance experiment. Daya Bay requires ${\mathcal P}_{ee}$ in vacuum and thus the simple analytic formula negates the need for an approximate formula. However, improved data from T2K will soon become sensitive to the hierarchy, and thus require a more careful treatment of that aspect. For the other cases, we choose an expansion by Akhmedov et al. which systematically includes all terms through second order in $\sinθ_{13}$ and in $α=: Δ_{21}/Δ_{31}$ ($Δ_{jk} =: m^2_j - m^2_k$). For the T2K disappearance experiment the approximation is quite accurate. However, for the T2K appearance experiment the approximate formula is not precise enough for addressing such questions as hierarchy or the existence of CP violation in the lepton sector. We suggest the use of numerical calculations of the oscillation probabilities, which are stable, accurate, and efficient and eliminate the possibility that differences in analyses are emanating from different approximations.</summary>

    <title>Connection Between $ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ$ and $ν_1, ν_2, ν_3$ Neutrino States and Time Dependence of Neutrino Wave Functions and Transition Probabilities at Three Neutrino Oscillations in Vacuum</title>

    <summary>  For description of the $d, s, b$ quark mixings the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices are used but they do not contain the time dependence. In this work the analogous matrix is obtained for the case of three neutrino ($ν_{e}, ν_{μ}, ν_τ$) mixings (oscillations) in vacuum in the general case, when CP violation is absent. In contrast to the quark case this matrix contains the time dependence. The matrix for probability of neutrino transitions (oscillations) in vacuum is also obtained. Naturally, it contains the time dependence. The matrix which does not contain the time dependence is obtained by using time $t$ averaging of this matrix. Elements of this matrix can be used to describe neutrino decays.</summary>
