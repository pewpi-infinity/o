    <summary>  Pyroelectric crystals are used to produce self-focused electron beams with energies greater than 170 keV. No high voltage power supply or electron gun is needed. The system works by simply changing the temperature of a crystal of LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 by about 100oC in dilute gas. Electron beam energy spectra as well as positive-ion-beam energy spectra and profiles are shown. A change in the crystal temperature of 100oC will cause a spontaneous change in polarization. The change in polarization will be manifested by a change in charge on the surface of the crystal. It is this uncompensated charge that produces the electric field, which accelerates the electrons, or the positive ions and gives rise to the plasma, which in turn focuses them. The source of the accelerated electrons or positive ions is gas molecules ionized near the crystal surface. When the crystal surface is negative electrons are accelerated away from it and positive ions are attracted to the surface. These positive ions reduce the net negative charge on the surface thereby reducing the electric field, which causes the electron energy to decrease over time even though the focal properties remain unchanged. When the surface is positive the reverse obtains and the positive ion beam energy decreases over time as well. We will present video clips, photographic and electronic data that demonstrate many of the characteristics and applications of these electron beams.</summary>

    <summary>K-shell ionization and characteristic x-ray radiation (CXR) by high-energy electrons and positrons in oriented silicon crystals are studied using computer simulation. A method for this simulation has been developed and is described in detail. The evolution of the angular distribution of CXR from the upstream surface of the crystal with changes in the angle between the incident particle momentum and the crystal &lt;100&gt; axis or (100) plane, as well as with changes in particle energy over a wide range (1-1000 GeV), is investigated. It is shown that in most cases this evolution is non-monotonic. The physical mechanisms underlying this behavior are discussed. In particular, the impact of the dechanneling process on CXR produced by electrons is analyzed.</summary>

    <title>Surface-barrier detector with smoothly tunable thickness of depleted layer for study of ionization loss and dechanneling length of negatively charged particles channeling in a crystal</title>

    <summary>A new method for the experimental study of ionization loss of relativistic negatively charged particles moving in a crystal in the channeling regime using a semiconductor surface-barrier detector with smoothly tunable thickness of the depleted layer is proposed. The ionization loss can only be measured in the depleted layer of the detector. The thickness of the depleted layer in a flat semiconductor detector can be smoothly regulated by the value of the bias voltage of the detector. Therefore, the energy distribution of the ionization loss of relativistic particles which cross the detector and move in the channeling regime in the detector crystal can be measured along the path of the particles at variation of the bias voltage of the detector. Ionization loss spectra should be different for channeling and nonchanneling particles, and both fractions can be determined. The application of a Si surface-barrier detector-target is considered. Measurements with such a detector would make it possible to study: the energy distribution of ionization loss of channeling negatively and positively charged particles; spatial distribution of ionization loss as a function of the path length of channeling particles; the dechanneling length of negatively charged particles; and to clear up the role of rechanneling of the particles in the crystal. Comparison of experimental data with calculations can help to develop a description of the dynamics of motion of negatively charged particles channeling in a crystal. A better understanding of the dechanneling length properties can be useful in the production of positrons and other particles such as neutrons by an electron beam in crystals, and in the development of crystalline undulators, and at a crystal-based extraction of electron beams from a synchrotron.</summary>
