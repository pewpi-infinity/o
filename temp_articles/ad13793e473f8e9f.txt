    <summary>We report on the generation of a three-octave-wide supercontinuum extending from the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) to the near-infrared, spanning at least 113 to 1000 nm (i.e., 11 to 1.2 eV), in He-filled hollow-core kagome-style photonic crystal fiber. Numerical simulations confirm that the main mechanism is a novel and previously undiscovered interaction between dispersive-wave emission and plasma-induced blueshifted soliton recompression around the fiber zero dispersion frequency. The VUV part of the supercontinuum, which modeling shows to be coherent and possess a simple phase structure, has sufficient bandwidth to support single-cycle pulses of 500 attosecond duration. We also demonstrate, in the same system, the generation of narrower-band VUV pulses, through dispersive-wave emission, tunable from 120 to 200 nm with efficiencies exceeding 1% and VUV pulse energies in excess of 50 nJ.</summary>

    <title>Geometrical and energy scaling in the pulsed laser deposition plasma during epitaxial growth of FeSe thin films</title>

    <summary>Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile technique for growing epitaxial heterostructures of a wide variety of novel materials combinations. Achieving low-defect layers with atomically sharp interfaces by PLD requires careful management of crystal growth conditions. Control over the flux of depositing particles, their kinetic energy, and the substrate temperature, is generally sufficient to obtain high-quality single crystal epitaxy in vacuum. In this article, we show that measurements of plasma parameters such as the electron temperature, the electron density, and the Mach number of the plasma fluid expansion may provide additional insights into the tuning of the crystal growth and processing environment of PLD. We report Langmuir probe measurements during growth of FeSe thin films on (100)-oriented SrTiO$_3$. We discuss two distinct plasma regimes that are accessible by KrF laser ablation of FeSe when pulse energies in the 20-630 mJ range are used. The two regimes can be characterized by the relative number of photons to absorbing centers in the laser-plasma interaction volume. Thin films grown under the conditions created by these two distinct plasma regimes are analyzed by x-ray diffraction and x-ray reflectivity and their epitaxial configurations correlated to the PLD conditions associated with these plasmas.</summary>

    <title>In-situ, variable thickness, liquid crystal film target inserter for moderate repetition rate intense laser applications</title>
    <updated>2015-08-18T14:53:31Z</updated>

    <summary>Liquid crystal films have recently been demonstrated as variable thickness, planar targets for ultra-intense laser matter experiments and applications such as ion acceleration. By controlling the parameters of film formation, including liquid crystal temperature and volume, their thickness can be varied on-demand from 10 $nm$ to above 10 $μm$. This thickness range enables for the first time real-time selection and optimization of various ion acceleration mechanisms using low cost, high quality targets. Our previous work employed these targets in single shot configuration, requiring chamber cycling after the pre-made films were expended. Presented here is a film formation device capable of drawing films from a bulk liquid crystal source volume to any thickness in the aforementioned range. This device will form films under vacuum within 2 $μm$ of the same location each time, well within the Rayleigh range of even tight $F/ \#$ systems. The repetition rate of the device exceeds 0.1 $Hz$ for sub-100 $nm$ films, enabling inexpensive, moderate repetition rate plasma target insertion for state of the art lasers currently in use or under development. Characterization tests of the device performed at the Scarlet laser facility at Ohio State will be presented.</summary>
