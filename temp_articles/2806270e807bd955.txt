    <summary>A comprehensive study of selected properties of four (TiZrNbCu)_1-xNi_x (x \le 0.25) amorphous high entropy alloys (a-HEA) has been performed. The samples were ribbons about 20 \mum thick and their fully amorphous state was verified by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. The surface morphology, precise composition and the distribution of components were studied with a Scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment. The properties selected were the melting temperature (T_m), the low temperature specific heat (LTSH), the magnetic susceptibility χ_exp and the Young^,s modulus (E). Whereas LTSH and χ_exp were measured for the as-cast samples, E was measured both for as-cast samples and relaxed samples (after a short anneal close to the glass transition temperature). The LTSH showed that the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N_0(E_F), decreases with increasing x, whereas the Debye temperature (θ_D) increases with x. This is similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early transition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that N_0(E_F) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE. The LTSH also showed the absence of superconductivity down to 1.8K and indicated the emergence of the Boson peak above 4K in all alloys.The free-electron like paramagnetic contribution to χ_exp also decreases with x, whereas E, like θ_D, increases with x, indicating enhanced interatomic bonding on addition of Ni. The applicability of the rule of mixtures to these and other similar HEAs is briefly discussed.</summary>

    <title>Electron-boson spectral density of LiFeAs obtained from optical data</title>

    <summary>We analyze existing optical data in the superconducting state of LiFeAs at $T =$ 4 K, to recover its electron-boson spectral density. A maximum entropy technique is employed to extract the spectral density $I^2χ(ω)$ from the optical scattering rate. Care is taken to properly account for elastic impurity scattering which can importantly affect the optics in an $s$-wave superconductor, but does not eliminate the boson structure. We find a robust peak in $I^2χ(ω)$ centered about $Ω_R \cong$ 8.0 meV or 5.3 $k_B T_c$ (with $T_c =$ 17.6 K). Its position in energy agrees well with a similar structure seen in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). There is also a peak in the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data at this same energy. This peak is found to persist in the normal state at $T =$ 23 K. There is evidence that the superconducting gap is anisotropic as was also found in low temperature angular resolved photoemission (ARPES) data.</summary>

    <title>Evolution of electron-boson spectral density in the underdoped region of Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_6</title>

    <summary>We use a maximum entropy technique to obtain the electron-boson spectral density from optical scattering rate data across the underdoped region of the Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_6 (Bi-2201) phase diagram. Our method involves a generalization of previous work which explicitly include finite temperature and the opening of a pseudogap which modifies the electronic structure. We find that the mass enhancement factor λassociated with the electron-boson spectral density increases monotonically with reduced doping and closer proximity to the Mott antiferromagnetic insulating state. This observation is consistent with increased coupling to the spin fluctuations. At the same time the system has reduced metallicity because of increased pseudogap effects which we model with a reduced effective density of states around the Fermi energy with the range of the modifications in energy set by the pseudogap scale.</summary>
