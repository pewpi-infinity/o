    <summary>It is shown that the superconducting energy gap necessarily lead to the disappearance of some quasi-electrons, thus we suggest a new boson-fermion Hamiltonian to describe superconductivity. The new supercurrent equations are derived with this Hamiltonian. Some new results can be found besides the zero resistance effect, the Meissner effect and the magnetic flux quantum can be explained.</summary>

    <summary>  There continues to be enormous interest in the BCS to BEC transition as there still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance) superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW) isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair) has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a Feshbach resonance form of SC.</summary>

    <title>Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits</title>

    <summary>High-fidelity quantum simulations demand hardware-software co-design architectures, which are crucial for adapting to complex problems such as strongly correlated dynamics in condensed matter. By leveraging co-design strategies, we can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) and early error-correction regimes. In this direction, we propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models, including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In this example, we obtain time-dependent state fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</summary>
