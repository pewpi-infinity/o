    <summary>A method is described for levitating micron-sized few layer graphene flakes in a quadrupole ion trap. Starting from a liquid suspension containing graphene, charged flakes are injected into the trap using the electrospray ionization technique and are probed optically. At micro-torr pressures, torques from circularly polarized light cause the levitated particles to rotate at frequencies &gt;1 MHz, which can be inferred from modulation of light scattering off the rotating flake when an electric field resonant with the rotation rate is applied. Possible applications of these techniques will be presented, both to fundamental measurements of the mechanical and electronic properties of graphene and to new approaches to graphene crystal growth, modification and manipulation.</summary>

    <summary>The chemical activity of ionized hydrogen describes the potency of protons in solution and is used to define the pH with wide-ranging applications in biological and materials sciences. Measuring pH with graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) has been described in the past but has yet to be characterized with a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. hBN capping is hypothesized to lower the chemical affinity of protons to oxidized defects in the graphene crystal and lower the standard deviation of pH measurement via screening charge density. First, the electronic properties of commercial, monolayer graphene and monolayer hBN/graphene, both on four-inch 90 nm SiO2/p-type Si, were contrasted as a function of solutal pH in 10 mM phosphate buffered solution. The two-dimensional (2D) FETs were fabricated with photoresistless metallization followed by microcentrifuge tube-masking and reactive ion etching to define a quasi-pure 2D sensing mesa for pH sensing. Thereafter, the devices were exposed to phosphate buffer of varying pH and the resistance and liquid-transfer characteristics measured. The hBN/graphene/SiO2 FETs had higher linearity, and both lower standard deviation and range of Dirac voltage shifting than monolayer graphene/SiO2. Then, before microcentrifuge tube-masking, freshly metallized devices were coated with 9 nm of Al2O3 by electron beam deposition. The Al2O3/graphene/SiO2 and Al2O3/hBN/graphene/SiO2 devices showed an altered response to the pH of the phosphate buffered solutions before and after basic etching of the Al2O3 with NaOH (pH = 12). This prompted studying the pH-dependencies of the 2D devices as a function of the thickness of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition. These results show that modifying the surface of monolayer graphene with nanoscale dielectrics enables tuning of the pH-dependent electronic properties of graphene pH sensors.</summary>

    <summary>Understanding charge transfer (CT) between two chemical entities and subsequent change in their charge densities is essential not only for molecular species but also for various low-dimensional materials. Because of their extremely high fraction of surface atoms, two-dimensional (2-D) materials are most susceptible to charge exchange and exhibit drastically different physicochemical properties depending on their charge density. In this regard, spontaneous and uncontrollable ionization of graphene in the ambient air has caused much confusion and technical difficulty in achieving experimental reproducibility since its first report in 2004. Moreover, the same ambient hole doping was soon observed in 2-D semiconductors, which implied that a common mechanism should be operative and apply to other low-dimensional materials universally. In this Account, we review our breakthroughs in unraveling the chemical origin and mechanistic requirements of the hidden CT reactions using 2-D crystals. We developed in-situ optical methods to quantify charge density using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and imaging. Using gas and temperature-controlled in-situ measurements, we revealed that the electrical holes are injected by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR): $O_{2}$ + $4H^{+}$ + $4e^{-}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ $2H_{2}O$, which was independently verified by pH dependence in HCl solutions. In addition to oxygen and water vapor, the overall CT reaction requires hydrophilic dielectric substrates, which assist hydration of the sample-substrate interface. The interface-localized reaction allowed us to visualized and control interfacial molecular diffusion and CT by varing the 2-D gap spacing and introducing defects. The complete mechanism of the fundamental charge exchange summarized in this Account will be essential in exploring material and device properties of other low dimensional materials.</summary>
