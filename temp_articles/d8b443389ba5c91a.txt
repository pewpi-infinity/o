    <summary>Rapidly rotating black holes are known to develop instabilities in the presence of a sufficiently light boson, a process which becomes efficient when the boson's Compton wavelength is roughly the size of the black hole. This phenomenon, known as black hole superradiance, generates an exponentially growing boson cloud at the expense of the rotational energy of the black hole. For astrophysical black holes with $M \sim \mathcal{O}(10) \, M_\odot$, the superradiant condition is achieved for bosons with $m_b \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-11} ) \, {\rm eV}$; intriguingly, photons traversing the intergalactic medium (IGM) acquire an effective mass (due to their interactions with the ambient plasma) which naturally resides in this range. The implications of photon superradiance, i.e. the evolution of the superradiant photon cloud and ambient plasma in the presence of scattering and particle production processes, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we enumerate and discuss a number of different processes capable of quenching the growth of the photon cloud, including particle interactions with the ambient electrons and back-reactions on the effective mass (arising e.g. from thermal effects, pair-production, ionization of of the local background, and modifications to the dispersion relation from strong electric fields). This work naturally serves as a guide in understanding how interactions may allow light exotic bosons to evade superradiant constraints.</summary>

    <summary>When electron-hole pairs are excited in a semiconductor, it is a priori not clear if they form a fermionic plasma of unbound particles or a bosonic exciton gas. Usually, the exciton phase is associated with low temperatures. In atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, excitons are particularly important even at room temperature due to strong Coulomb interaction and a large exciton density of states. Using state-of-the-art many-body theory including dynamical screening, we show that the exciton-to-plasma ratio can be efficiently tuned by dielectric substrate screening as well as charge carrier doping. Moreover, we predict a Mott transition from the exciton-dominated regime to a fully ionized electron-hole plasma at excitation densities between $3\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ depending on temperature, carrier doping and dielectric environment. We propose the observation of these effects by studying excitonic satellites in photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy.</summary>

    <title>Patchy Screening of the CMB from Dark Photons</title>

    <summary>We study anisotropic (patchy) screening induced by the resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into dark-sector massive vector bosons (dark photons) as they cross non-linear large scale structure (LSS). Resonant conversion takes place through the kinetic mixing of the photon with the dark photon, one of the simplest low energy extensions to the Standard Model. In the early Universe, resonant conversion can occur when the photon plasma mass, obtained as the photon propagates through the ionized interstellar and intergalactic media, matches the dark photon mass. After the epoch of reionization, resonant conversion occurs mainly in the ionized gas that occupies virialized dark matter halos, for a range of dark photon masses between $10^{-13} {\rm \; eV} \lesssim m_{\rm A^{\prime}} \lesssim 10^{-11} {\rm \; eV}$. This leads to new CMB anisotropies that are correlated with LSS, which we refer to as patchy dark screening, in analogy with anisotropies from Thomson screening. Its unique frequency dependence allows it to be distinguished from the blackbody CMB. In this paper, we use a halo model approach to predict the imprint of dark screening on the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, as well as their correlation with LSS. We then examine the two- and three-point correlation functions of the dark-screened CMB, as well as correlation functions between CMB and LSS observables, to project the sensitivity of future measurements to the kinetic mixing parameter and dark photon mass. We demonstrate that an analysis with existing CMB data can improve upon current constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter by two orders of magnitude with the two-point correlation functions, while data from upcoming CMB experiments and LSS surveys can further improve the reach by another order of magnitude with two- and three-point correlation functions.</summary>
