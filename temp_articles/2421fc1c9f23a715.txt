    <summary>For the first time, this study shows that distortion in a crystal structure due to magnetic effect is possible in a lattice with extreme chemical disorder. The multicomponent equimolar transition metal oxide (ME TMO), (Co,Cu,Mg,Ni,Zn)O, which is a high entropy oxide, has been attracting a lot of attention due to its unique application potential in many fields including electrochemical energy storage. In the present investigation, nanocrystalline ME TMO was synthesised by three bottom up methods. The presence of distortion in the rocksalt crystal structure, revealed by X ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and correlated with magnetic measurements from SQUID and EPR studies could be attributed to the additive effects of exchange striction (from the magnetic constituents) and magnetic anisotropy (from the decreased crystallite size). For the first time, iron has been doped into ME TMO, to show that a higher amount of magnetic constituent increases the distortion in the lattice. Nanocrystalline ME TMO also showed a core shell magnetic behavior below the bifurcation temperature arising from the uncompensated or canted spin at the surface. Neel temperature of the nanocrystalline ME TMO is reported for first time to be as high as 700 K. This study helps unravel the structure and magnetic properties of such high entropy materials, and augurs a definite scope for better understanding of the factors influencing the crystal structure in high entropy oxides.</summary>

    <summary>Entropic contributions to the stability of solids are very well understood and the mixing entropy has been used for forming various solids, for instance such as inverse spinels. A particular development was related to high entropy alloys in which the configurational disorder is responsible for forming simple solid solutions and which are thoroughly studied for various applications especially due to their mechanical properties but also electrical properties, hydrogen storage, magnetic properties. Many unexplored compositions and properties still remain for this class of materials due to their large phase space. In a recent report it has been shown that the configurational disorder can be used for stabilizing simple solid solutions of oxides, which should normally not form solid solutions, these new materials were called "entropy-stabilized oxides". In this pioneering report, it was shown that mixing five equimolar binary oxides yielded, after heating at high temperature and quenching, an unexpected rock salt structure compound with statistical distribution of the cations in a face centered cubic lattice. Following this seminal study, we show here that these high entropy oxides (named HEOx hereafter) can be substituted by aliovalent elements with a charge compensation mechanism. This possibility largely increases the potential development of new materials by widening their (already complex) phase space. As a first example, we report here that at least one HEOx composition exhibits colossal dielectric constants, which could make it very promising for applications as large-k dielectric materials.</summary>

    <summary>The field of high entropy oxides (HEOs) flips traditional materials science paradigms on their head by seeking to understand what properties arise in the presence of profound configurational disorder. This disorder, which originates from multiple elements sharing a single lattice site, can take on a kaleidoscopic character due to the vast numbers of possible elemental combinations. High configurational disorder appears to imbue some HEOs with functional properties that far surpass their non-disordered analogs. While experimental discoveries abound, efforts to characterize the true magnitude of the configurational entropy and understand its role in stabilizing new phases and generating superior functional properties have lagged behind. Understanding the role of configurational disorder in existing HEOs is the crucial link to unlocking the rational design of new HEOs with targeted properties. In this Perspective, we attempt to establish a framework for articulating and beginning to address these questions in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the true role of entropy in HEOs.</summary>
