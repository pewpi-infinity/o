    <summary>Anyon usually exists as collective excitation of two dimensional electron gas subjected to strong magnetic field, carrying fractional charges and exotic statistical character beyond fermion and boson. Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is the only experimental system showing solid evidence of anyon and a serial of fractional charges so far. Searching for new serial of fractional charges in FQHE or other physical system is still a challenge for both theoretical and experimental study. Here a topological fusion theory of propagating paths winding around a pair of fluxes is proposed to explore the physical origin of fractional charges. This topological path fusion theory not only generated all of the existed serial of fractional charges in FQHE and found the exact correspondence between FQHE and integral quantum Hall effect (IQHE), but also predicted new serial of fractional charges in FQHE. Further more, serial irrational charges like $2/(3+\sqrt{2})$ in one dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes as well as that in two dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes, such as $(1+\sqrt{2})$, are predicted. Even in three dimensional network of magnetic fluxes, a serial of fractionally charged anyon is predicted by this topological path fusion theory, which has exactly correspondence with the knot lattice model of anyon. In fact, in a multi-connected space time without magnetic field, this topological path fusion theory still holds, revealing an universal existence of fractional charge and mass in quantum material with strong confinement of particles (such as photonic crystal with porous nano-structures) and paving a new way for topological quantum computation.</summary>

    <summary>The mimicry of crystalline microstructure at meso-scale creates a new class of architected materials, termed meta-crystals, and offers effective ways to significantly improve the toughness and eliminate the post-yield collapse of architected materials. This study investigated the mechanical behaviour of polygrain-like meta-crystals fabricated from Ti6Al4V by laser powder bed fusion. The mechanical behaviour of Ti6Al4V meta-crystals is governed by lattice structures across length-scales: the crystalline microstructure, architected crystal-like mesostructures and the quality of lattice struts. Due to the intricate architecture, significant processing defects were seen in the printed meta-crystals, in particular notch-like defects due to lack of fusion at the free surface of struts. Such defects raised stress concentration and reduced the load-bearing area of struts, hence significantly weakening the lattice struts. In addition, the as-printed condition was brittle due to the presence of acicular alpha' martensites. The defects and the as-printed brittleness led to the premature fracture of struts and compromised the benefits of the crystal-inspired mesostructures. The study subsequently conducted multiple measures to resolve this issue: increasing the strut diameter to reduce the influence of the process defects, and annealing to relieve internal stresses and regain ductility. The combination of the increase in strut diameter and annealing successfully enabled the crystal-like architected mesostructure to effectively improve the toughness of the meta-crystals.</summary>

    <summary>We first show a possible mechanism to create a new type of nuclear fusion, thermal resonance fusion, i.e. low energy nuclear fusion with thermal resonance of light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium or tritium. The fusion of two light nuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up to the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be realized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light atoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal resonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of the deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion mechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how these light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of metal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal vibrations and resonances at different modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect at different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates the thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect, is possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very sharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for thermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or make the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable compound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the penetrating probability larger than 10^{-10}.</summary>
