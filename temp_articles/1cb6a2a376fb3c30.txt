    <summary>We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic α-iron, taking account of the quantum fluctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.</summary>

    <summary>Freely falling point-like objects converge toward the center of the Earth. Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the superconducting system.
  A "Cavendish-like" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational perturbations are present.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Calculations of Hydrogen Absorption and Diffusivity in Bulk $\mathrm{CeO_2}$</title>

    <summary>CeO$_2$ (ceria) is an attractive material for heterogeneous catalysis applications involving hydrogen due to its favorable redox activity combined with its relative impermeability to hydrogen ions and molecules. However, to date, many bulk ceria/hydrogen properties remain unresolved in part due to a scarcity of experimental data combined with quantum calculation results that vary according to the approach used. In this regard, we have conducted a series of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations utilizing generalized gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals as well as several corrections for electronic correlations, applied to a number of properties regarding hydrogen in bulk stoichiometic $\mathrm{CeO_2}$. Our calculations place reasonable bounds on the lattice constants, band gaps, hydrogen absorption energies, and O-H bond vibrational frequencies that can be determined by DFT. In addition, our results indicate that the activation energy barriers for hydrogen bulk diffusion are uniformly low ($ &lt; 0.15 \ \mathrm{eV} $) for the calculation parameters probed here and that, in general, the effect of hydrogen tunneling is small at ambient temperatures. Our study provides a recipe to determine fundamental physical chemical properties of Ce-O-H interactions while also determining realistic ranges for diffusion kinetics. This can facilitate the determination of future coarse-grained models that will be able to guide and elucidate experimental efforts in this area.</summary>
