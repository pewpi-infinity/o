    <summary>Topological effects exist from a macroscopic system such as the universe to a microscopic system described by quantum mechanics. We show here that an interesting geometric structure can be created by the self replication procedure of a square with an enclosed circle, in which the sum of the circles area will remain the same but the sum of the circumference will increase. It is demonstrated by means of Monte Carlo simulations that these topological features have great impacts to the vacuum pumping probability and the photon absorption probability of the active surface. The results show significant improvement of the system performance and have application potential in vacuum pumping of large research facilities such as a nuclear fusion reactor, synchrotron and in photovoltaic industry.</summary>

    <title>Probing the non-Abelian fusion of a pair of Majorana zero modes</title>

    <summary>In this work, we perform real time simulations for probing the non-Abelian fusion of a pair of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The nontrivial fusion outcomes can be either a vacuum, or an unpaired fermion, which reflect the underlying non-Abelian statistics. The two possible outcomes can cause different charge variations in the nearby probing quantum dot (QD), while the charge occupation in the dot is detected by a quantum point contact. In particular, we find that gradual fusion and gradual coupling of the MZMs to the QD (in nearly adiabatic switching-on limit) provide a simpler detection scheme than sudden coupling after fusion to infer the coexistence of two fusion outcomes, by measuring the occupation probability of the QD. For the scheme of sudden coupling (after fusion), we propose and analyze continuous weak measurement for the quantum oscillations of the QD occupancy. From the power spectrum of the measurement currents, one can identify the characteristic frequencies and infer thus the coexistence of the fusion outcomes.</summary>

    <title>Low-energy fusion caused by an interference</title>

    <summary>Fusion of two deuterons of room temperature energy is studied. The nuclei are in vacuum with no connection to any external source (electric or magnetic field, illumination, surrounding matter, traps, etc.) which may accelerate them. The energy of the two nuclei is conserved and remains small during the motion through the Coulomb barrier. The penetration through this barrier, which is the main obstacle for low-energy fusion, strongly depends on a form of the incident flux on the Coulomb center at large distances from it. In contrast to the usual scattering, the incident wave is not a single plane wave but the certain superposition of plane waves of the same energy and various directions, for example, a convergent conical wave. As a result of interference, the wave function close to the Coulomb center is determined by a cusp caustic which is probed by de Broglie waves. The particle flux gets away from the cusp and moves to the Coulomb center providing a not small probability of fusion (cusp driven tunneling). Getting away from a caustic cusp also occurs in optics and acoustics.</summary>
