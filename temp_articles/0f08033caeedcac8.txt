    <summary>Superconducting materials hold great potential to bring radical changes for electric power and high-field magnet technology , enabling high-efficiency electric power generation, high-capacity lossless electric power transmission, small light-weighted electrical equipment, high-speed maglev transportation, ultra-strong magnetic field generation for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems, the future advanced high energy particle accelerators, nuclear fusion reactors and so on. The performance, economy and operating parameters (temperatures and magnetic fields) of these applications strongly depend on the electromagnetic and mechanical properties, as well as manufacturing and material cost of superconductors. This perspective examines the basic properties relevant to practical applications and key issues of wire fabrication for practical superconducting materials, and describes their challenges and current state in practical applications. Finally, future perspectives for their opportunities and development in the applications of superconducting power and magnetic technologies are given.</summary>

    <summary>Nowadays the development of high-field magnets strongly relies on the performance of superconducting materials. Iron-based superconductors exhibit high upper critical fields and low electromagnetic anisotropy, making them particularly attractive for high-field applications, especially in particle accelerator magnets, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, medical magnetic resonance imaging systems and nuclear fusion reactors. Herein, through an industrially scalable and cost-effective manufacturing strategy, a practical level critical current density up to 1.1x10^5 A/cm2 at 4.2 K in an external magnetic field of 10 T was achieved in Cu/Ag composite sheathed Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 superconducting tapes. The preparation strategy combines flat rolling to induce grain texture and a subsequent hot-isostatic-pressing densification. By varying the parameters of rolling, the degree of grain texture was engineered. It is found that the transport properties of the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 tapes can be enhanced by applying a large amount of deformation during rolling, which can be attributed to the improved degree of c-axis texture. Microstructure characterizations on the highest-performance tape demonstrate that the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 phase has a uniform element distribution and small grains with good connectivity. Grain boundary pinning is consequently enhanced as proved by large currents circulating through the sample even at 25 K. Our work proves that Cu/Ag composite sheathed Ba1-xKxFe2As2 superconducting tapes can be a promising competitor for practical high-field applications in terms of the viable, scalable and cost-effective fabrication strategy applied and the high transport properties achieved in this work.</summary>

    <title>Charged Particle Resonance In Induction Field</title>

    <summary>Starting from First Principles, the space charge manipulation of charged particles in an induction field in free space based on an unique Magnetic field strength and its oscillation Frequency relationship is demonstrated numerically and theoretically. The Larmor precession frequency for a time varying magnetic field, instead of conventionally followed static magnetic field is derived for the first time. With the dispersion relation in Ion Resonance depending on its frequency of gyration, an AC driven electromagnet based particle resonance has been proposed circumventing the use of Superconducting Permanent Magnets. Complete resonance achieved under the proposed conditions results in a sustained, fixed-frequency particle trajectory that is independent of its speed or drift. Such oscillation is visualized in a D-Shaped Resonant assembly. The amplitude and the wavelength calculations for the trajectory are demonstrated analytically. Principally noting the objectives of Synchrotron in varying the magnetic field and its frequency to generate high energy particles, the present theory addresses the same. Its applications can be explored in Space Propulsion Systems, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and sub-harmonic heating and cooling. Using this theory one can aptly generate RF Power using device specific designed resonant antennas coupling it with with Plasma.</summary>
