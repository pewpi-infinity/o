    <summary>Position-dependent property of the neutrino produced in high-energy pion decay is studied theoretically using a wave packet formalism. It is found that the neutrino probability has a universal finite-distance correction if the pion has a long coherence length. This correction has origins in the interference of the neutrino that is caused by the small neutrino mass and a light-cone singularity of the pion and muon system. This term is positive definite and leads excess to the neutrino flux over the in-coherent value at macroscopic distance of near detector region. The flux decreases slowly with distance in a universal manner that is determined by the absolute value of the neutrino mass and energy. Absolute value of the neutrino mass is expected to be measured indirectly from the neutrino detection probability at finite distance.</summary>

    <summary>We study the neutrino mass anarchy in the Dirac neutrino, seesaw, double seesaw models. Assuming the anarchy hypothesis, the mass matrices are random and distributed in accordance with the Gaussian measure. We focus on the distributions of mass square ratio of the light neutrinos and examine which of these models shows a peak in the probability distribution around the experimental value. We show that the peak position depends on the number of random matrix products. We find that the light neutrino mass hierarchy becomes larger as the number of random matrix products is increased and the seesaw model with the random Dirac and Majorana mass matrices is the most probable to realize the current experimental data. We also investigate the distributions of the effective Majorana mass for neutrinoless double beta decay. We find that the effective Majorana mass is smaller than the experimental upper bound and tends to be smaller as the number of random matrix products increases because the light neutrino masses become more hierarchical. We argue that the tendency for lighter neutrino masses to become more hierarchical as the number of products in the random matrix increases can be understood from the probability distribution of singular values in random matrix theory.</summary>

    <summary>The probability of the event that a neutrino produced in pion decay is detected in the intermediate $T$ shorter than the life-time $τ_π$, $T \leq τ_π$, is sensitive to the absolute mass of the neutrino. With a newly formulated S-matrix $S[T]$ that satisfies the boundary conditions of the experiments at a finite $T$, the rate of the event is computed as $Γ_0+\tilde{g}(ω_ν, {T};τ_π) \tilde Γ_{1} $, where $\tilde{g}(ω_ν,{T};τ_π)$ depends weakly on $τ_π$ and $ω_ν={m_ν^2c^4}/{(2E_ν\hbar)}$, $c$ is the speed of light. $Γ_0$ is the standard one and the correction, $\tilde{g}(ω_ν, {T};τ_π) \tilde Γ_{1} $, reflects relativistic invariance and is rigorously computed via the light-cone singularity of the system and reveals the diffraction pattern of a single quantum. The formula explains unsolved anomalies of neutrino experiments and indicates the heavy neutrino mass, $0.098 \pm 0.022$ or $0.083 \pm 0.026$ {eV}/ $c^2$ for normal or inverted mass hierarchies, respectively.</summary>
