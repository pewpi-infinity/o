    <summary>The electronic structure of singly ionized tin (SnII) is partly a one-electron and partly a three-electron system with ground configuration 5s25p. The excited configurations are of the type 5s2nl in the one-electron part, and 5s5p2, 5p3 and 5s5pnl (nl = 6s, 5d) in the three-electron system with quartet and doublet levels. The spectrum analyzed in this work was recorded on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph of the Antigonish laboratory (Canada) in the wavelength region 300 - 2080 Å using a triggered spark source. The existing interpretation of the one-electron level system was confirmed in this paper, while the 2S1/2 level of the 5s5p2 configuration has been revised. The analysis has been extended to include new configurations 5p3, 5s5p5d and 5s5p6s with the aid of superposition-of-configurations Hartree-Fock calculations with relativistic corrections. The ionization potential obtained from the ng series was found to be 118023.7(5) cm-1 (14.63307(6) eV). We give a complete set of critically evaluated data on energy levels, observed wavelengths and transition probabilities of Sn II in the range 888 - 10740 Å involving excitation of the n = 5 electrons.</summary>

    <title>Spectrum of five-times ionized krypton: Kr VI</title>

    <summary>This work describes the spectral analysis of five-times ionized krypton ion (Kr VI) using a high-resolution spectrogram recorded on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph in the wavelength 230--2075~Å~region. For spectral excitation, a gas-puff triggered spark source was used. This work thoroughly examined all previously reported spectroscopic analyses for Kr VI. Many missing and new levels were added to the list of known energy levels with the help of several supportive transitions. The present experimental findings were theoretically supported within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) formalism implemented in the Cowan suite of codes. A total of 52 (including eight new) energy levels were established with the help of 169 unique observed spectral lines (31 are new) assigned to 175 (6 doubly assigned) transitions. All observed and Ritz wavelengths were reported with their uncertainties, modeled intensities, and other evaluated radiative transition parameters such as transition probabilities and cancellation factors.</summary>

    <title>Critically Evaluated Energy Levels, Wavelengths, Transition Probabilities, and Intensities of Six-Times Ionized Cesium: Cs VII</title>

    <summary>Previously reported works on the spectrum of Cs VII are critically studied using supplementary spectrograms recorded on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph in the wavelength region 300-1240 A at the Antigonish laboratory (Canada). We confirmed the results of the earlier work of Gayasov and Joshi on this spectrum. Our analysis is supported by extended calculations with the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) method with superposition of configuration interactions implemented in Cowan's suite of codes. In this critical evaluation, in addition to the accurate energy levels of Cs VII with their uncertainties, observed and Ritz wavelengths with uncertainties and transition probabilities, the uniformly-scaled intensities of Cs VII lines are also presented. A total of 196 lines attributed to 197 transitions enabled us to optimize the energy values of 72 levels in Cs VII spectrum. Furthermore, Ritz wavelengths of 141 possibly observable lines are provided along with their transition probabilities.</summary>
