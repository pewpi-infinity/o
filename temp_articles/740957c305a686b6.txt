    <summary>The electron spin-lattice relaxation of TEMPO and TEMPONE was measured at temperatures between 5 and 80 K in crystalline and glassy ethanol using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The experimental data at the lowest temperatures studied were explained in terms of electron-nuclear dipolar interaction between the paramagnetic center and the localized excitations, whereas at higher temperatures low-frequency vibrational modes from the host matrix and Raman processes should be considered. The strong impact of hydrogen bonding between the dopant molecule and ethanol host on the spin relaxation was observed in ethanol glass whereas in crystalline ethanol both paramagnetic guest molecules behaved similarly.</summary>

    <summary>Vanadium ions charge states and their incorporation in the yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12 (YAG) lattice were studied by the correlated optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. In as-grown crystals, the occupation of the V3+ at both the octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum sites was proven. The V3+ to V4+ charge transformation was observed after annealing in air, whereas annealing in the hydrogen atmosphere resulted exclusively in a slight weakening of the V3+ absorption bands due to partial recharge of these ions. Spin Hamiltonian parameters of the V3+ and V4+ ions at the tetrahedral sites including the zero field splitting and the 51V hyperfine constants have been determined using the high-frequency, up to 300 GHz, EPR measurements. From the analysis of the spin Hamiltonian parameters in the framework of the crystal field theory, the ground state energy levels splitting of the V3+ and V4+ ions were calculated. The charge distribution over the tetrahedral V3+ and its nearest oxygen surroundings was found to be strongly inhomogeneous whereas the tetrahedral V4+ ion concentrated the charge with very weak participation of surrounding ligands. Furthermore, the correlation of the optical and EPR data allowed the proper assignment of the optical absorption peaks in YAG:V crystals.</summary>

    <title>Vibrational states of a water molecule in a nano-cavity of beryl crystal lattice</title>

    <summary>Low-energy excitations of a single water molecule are studied when confined within a nano-size cage formed by the ionic crystal lattice. Optical spectra are measured of manganese doped beryl single crystal Mn:Be3Al2Si6O18, that contains water molecules individually isolated in 0.51 nm diameter voids within the crystal lattice. Two types of orientation are distinguished: water-I molecules have their dipole moments aligned perpendicular to the c axis, and dipole moments of water-II molecules are parallel to the c-axis. The optical conductivity and permittivity spectra are recorded in terahertz and infrared ranges, at frequencies from several wavenumbers up to 7000cm-1, at temperatures from 5K to 300K and for two polarizations, when the electric vector E of the radiation is parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. Comparative experiments on as-grown and on dehydrated samples allow to identify the conductivity and permittivity spectra caused exclusively by water molecules. In the infrared range well-known internal modes nu1, nu2 and nu3 of the H2O molecule are observed for both polarizations, indicating the presence of water-I and water-II molecules in the crystal. Spectra recorded below 1000cm-1 reveal a rich set of highly anisotropic features in the low-energy response of H2O molecule in a crystalline nanocage. While for E parallel to c only two absorption peaks are detected, at 90cm-1 and 160cm-1, several absorption bands are discovered for E perpendicular to c, each consisting of narrower resonances. The bands are assigned to librational and translational vibrations of water-I molecule that is weakly, via hydrogen bonds, coupled to the nanocage walls. A model is presented that explains the fine structure of the bands by splitting of the energy levels due to quantum tunneling between the minima in a six-well potential relief felt by a molecule within the cage.</summary>
