    <summary>It is shown that the Schrodinger equation for a large family of pairs of two-dimensional quantum potentials possess wavefuctions for which the amplitude and the phase are interchangeable, producing two different solutions which are dual to each other. This is a property of solutions with vanishing Bohm potential. These solutions can be extended to three-dimensional systems. We explicitly calculate dual solutions for physical systems, such as the repulsive harmonic oscillator and the two-dimensional hydrogen atom. These dual wavefunctions are also solutions of an analogue optical system in the eikonal limit. In this case, the potential is related to the refractive index, allowing the study of this two-dimensional dual wavefunction solutions with an optical (analogue) system.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Incompressibility of a Freely Falling Hydrogen Atom in a Circular Rydberg State, and a Gravitationally-Induced Charge Separation Effect in Superconducting Systems</title>

    <summary>Freely falling point-like objects converge toward the center of the Earth. Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the superconducting system.
  A "Cavendish-like" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational perturbations are present.</summary>

    <title>Quantum simulation of negative hydrogen ion using variational quantum eigensolver on IBM quantum computer</title>

    <summary>The negative hydrogen ion is the first three body quantum problem whose ground state energy is calculated using the `Chandrasekhar Wavefunction' that accounts for the electron-electron correlation. Solving multi-body systems is a daunting task in quantum mechanics as it includes choosing a trial wavefunction and the calculation of integrals for the system that becomes almost impossible for systems with three or more particles. This difficulty can be addressed by quantum computers. They have emerged as a tool to address different electronic structure problems with remarkable efficiency. They have been realized in various fields and proved their efficiency over classical computers. Here, we show the quantum simulation of H^{-} ion to calculate it's ground state energy in IBM quantum computer. The energy is found to be -0.5339355468 Hartree with an error of 0.8376% as compared to the theoretical value. We observe that the quantum computer is efficient in preparing the correlated wavefunction of H^{-} and calculating it's ground state energy. We use a recently developed algorithm known as `Variational Quantum Eigensolver' and implement it in IBM's 5-qubit quantum chip `ibmqx2'. The method consists of a quantum part i.e., state preparation and measurement of expectation values using the quantum computer, and the classical part i.e., the optimization routine run in a classical computer for energy convergence. An optimization routine is performed on classical computer by running quantum chemistry program and codes in QISKit to converge the energy to the minimum. We also present a comparison of different optimization routines and encoding methods used to converge the energy value to the minimum. The technique can be used to solve various many body problems with great efficiency.</summary>
