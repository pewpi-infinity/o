    <summary>High entropy materials, which include high entropy alloys, carbides, and borides, are a topic of substantial research interest due to the possibility of a large number of new material compositions that could fill gaps in application needs. There is a current need for materials exhibiting high temperature stability, particularly oxidation resistance. A systematic understanding of the oxidation behavior in high entropy materials is therefore required. Prior work notes large differences in the thermodynamic favorability between oxides formed upon oxidation of high entropy materials. This work uses both analytical and computational thermodynamic approaches to investigate and quantify the effects of this large variation and the resulting potential for preferential component oxidation in refractory high entropy materials including group IV-, V- and VI-element based alloys and ceramics. Thermodynamic calculations show that a large tendency towards preferential oxidation is expected in these materials, even for elements whose oxides exhibit a small difference in thermodynamic favorability. The effect is reduced in carbides, compared to their alloy counterparts. Further, preferential oxidation in high entropy refractory materials could result in possible destabilization of the solid solution or formation of other, competing phases, with corresponding changes in bulk material properties.</summary>

    <title>Configurational Entropy-Driven Phase Stability and Thermal Transport in Rock-Salt High-Entropy Oxides</title>

    <summary>High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including (Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($ΔS_{conf}$), challenging the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity ($κ$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $κ$ with increasing $ΔS_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while cooling) show high $κ$, demonstrating the role of $ΔS_{conf}$ on $κ$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\, driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring phonon transport.</summary>

    <title>Novel entropy-stabilized fluorite oxides with multifunctional properties</title>

    <summary>Development of new high-entropy oxides having configurational entropy dominating the phase stability has become a hot topic since the discovery of rock salt structure entropy-stabilized (ES)(MgCoNiCuZn)O in 2015. Herein, we report a set of novel entropy-stabilized fluorite oxides: Zr0.2Hf0.2Ce0.2Sn0.2Mn0.2O2-δ, Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.2O2-δ, Zr0.225Hf0.225Ti0.225Mn0.225Ce0.1O2-δ, and Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.1Ta0.05Fe0.05O2-δ synthesized using standard solid-state reaction. These compounds have been investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques to discern their structural, microstructural, and chemical properties. The configurational-entropy dominated phase stability and hence the entropy stabilization of the compounds is confirmed by cyclic heat treatments. The mismatch in the ionic radii and oxidation state of the cations are the key factors in achieving a single-phase fluorite structure. Further, screening of physical properties including thermal conductivity, optical band gap, magnetic properties, and impedance spectroscopy is discussed. Thermal conductivity of 1.4-1.7 Wm-1K-1 is observed at 300 K and remains mostly invariant across a wide temperature range (300K-1073K), favorable for thermal barrier coating applications. These ES samples have an optical band gap of 1.6-1.8 eV, enabling light absorption across the visible spectrum and hence could be promising for photocatalytic applications. The impedance spectroscopy data of the entropy-stabilized samples reveal the presence of electronic contributions with small activation energy (0.3-0.4 eV) across a temperature range of 298K-423K. These observations in ES fluorite systems show potential for their multifunctional applications via further optimization and confirm the great chemical versatility of entropy-stabilized oxides.</summary>
