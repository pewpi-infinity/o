    <summary>Plasma photonic crystals designed in this paper are composed of gas discharge tubes to control the flow of electromagnetic waves. The band structures calculated by the finite element method are consistent with the experimental results in that two distinct attenuation peaks appear in the ranges of 1 GHz to 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz to 6 GHz. Electromagnetic parameters of the plasma are extracted by the Nicolson-Ross-Weir method and effective medium theory. The measured electron density is between 1e11 cm-3 and 1e12 cm-3, which verifies the correctness of the parameter used in the simulation, and the collision frequency is near 1.5e10 Hz. As the band structures are corroborated by the measured scattering parameters, we introduce the concept of photonic topological insulator based on the quantum Valley Hall effect into the plasma photonic crystal. A valley-dependent plasma photonic crystal with hexagonal lattice is constructed, and the phase transition of the valley K(K') occurs by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Valley-spin locked topological edge states are generated and excited by chiral sources. The frequency of the non-bulk state can be dynamically regulated by the electron density. This concept paves the way for novel, tunable topological edge states. More interestingly, the Dirac cone is broken when the electron density increases to 3.1e12 cm-3, which distinguishes from the methods of applying a magnetic field and changing the symmetry of the point group.</summary>

    <summary>Dusty plasma crystals have traditionally been observed and studied in radio frequency (RF) discharge plasmas and their formation in a DC glow discharge plasma remains experimentally challenging. We report the first ever observation of a stable dusty plasma Coulomb crystal in the cathode sheath region of a DC glow discharge plasma. The observations are made in the DPEx device where crystals of mono-disperse Melamine Formaldehyde grains are produced in the background of an Argon plasma. The crystalline nature of the structure is confirmed through a host of measurements that includes the radial pair correlation function, Voronoi diagram, Delaunay Triangulation, the structural order parameter, the dust temperature and the Coulomb coupling parameter. The special features of the DPEx device that permit such a crystal formation are delineated and some principal physical features of the crystal discussed.</summary>

    <summary>The dispersion relation of plasma and plasma-dielectric photonic multilayer structures is approached in terms of a one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulation. For several plasma-dielectric configurations, the system response is obtained using a pulsed excitation and a subsequent two-dimensional frequency analysis. It is first shown that the dispersion relation of a single, homogeneous plasma slab is well described by the cold-plasma model even at low pressures of 1 Pa. The study is extended to the simulation of plasma photonic crystals with a variety of configurations, based on the work of Hojo and Mase [J. Plasma Fusion Res. 80, 89 (2004)]. Considering a one-dimensional plasma photonic crystal made from alternating layers of dielectric and homogeneous plasma slabs, it is shown that the assumption of a cold-plasma description is well justified also in this case. Moreover, in this work the results are reformatted and analyzed in a band diagram representation, in particular based on the lattice constant $a$. Based on these considerations a scaling invariant representation is presented, utilizing a generalized set of parameters. The study is completed with an exemplary comparison of three plasma-dielectric photonic crystal configurations and their corresponding band diagrams.</summary>
