    <summary>Wave-particle interaction (WPI) is one of the most fundamental processes in plasma physics in which one most prominent example is the Landau damping. Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.</summary>

    <summary>A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($σv$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \rightarrow n + α, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + α$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 α$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \le 1$ in the range of T from $\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.</summary>

    <summary>Ultra-magnetized plasmas, where the magnetic field strength exceeds the Schwinger field of about $B_{Q}\approx4\times10^{13}$~gauss, become of great scientific interest, thanks to the current advances in laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations of magnetar emission. These advances demand better understanding of how quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects influence collective plasma phenomena. In particular, Maxwell's equations become nonlinear in the strong-QED regime. Here we present the `QED plasma framework' which will allow one to {\em systematically} explore collective phenomena in a QED-plasma with arbitrarily strong magnetic field. Further, we illustrate the framework by exploring low-frequency modes in the ultra-magnetized, cold, electron-positron plasmas. We demonstrate that the classical picture of five branches holds in the QED regime; no new eigenmodes appear. The dispersion curves of all the modes are modified. The QED effects include the overall modification to the plasma frequency, which becomes field-dependent. They also modify resonances and cutoffs of the modes, which become both field- and angle-dependent. The strongest effects are (i) the {\em field-induced transparency of plasma} for the O-mode via the dramatic reduction of the low-frequency cutoff well below the plasma frequency, (ii) the {\em Alfven mode suppression} in the large-$k$ regime via the reduction of the Alfven mode resonance, and (iii) the {\em O-mode slowdown} via strong angle-dependent increase of the index of refraction. These results should be important for understanding of a magnetospheric pair plasma of a magnetar and for laboratory laser-plasma experiments in the QED regime.</summary>
