    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>
