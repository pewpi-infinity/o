    <summary>This paper reports the optical and structural properties of 400 nm nanocrystalline cadmium telluride thin films fabricated using a new vapor controller system in vacuum. This system is indeed a rotating cylinder placed in the material steam path during coating process. The upper cross section of the cylinder has one arc groove allowing the steam to pass through. Three type samples were made under different vapor controlling conditions namely; without controller system (conventional method), with rotating cylinder, and with upper cross section of the cylinder alone which acts as a rotating shutter. The prepared samples have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and UV-Vis Spectroscopy techniques. The results show, not only the structural properties were improved by this technique but also the band gap of samples were changed.</summary>

    <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Effects of Electron Propagation into Vacuum</title>

    <summary>Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we experimentally and theoretically investigate isolated platinum phthalocyanine (PtPc) molecules adsorbed on atomically thin NaCl(100) vapor deposited on Au(111). We obtain good agreement between theory and constant-height STM topography. We examine why strong distortions of STM images occur as a function of distance between molecule and STM tip. The images of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) exhibit, for increasing distance, significant radial expansion due to electron propagation in the vacuum. Additionally, the imaged angular dependence is substantially distorted. The LUMO image has substantial intensity along the molecular diagonals where PtPc has no atoms. In the electronic transport gap the image differs drastically from HOMO and LUMO, even at energies very close to these orbitals. As the tunneling becomes increasingly off-resonant, the eight angular lobes of the HOMO or of the degenerate LUMOs diminish and reveal four lobes with maxima along the molecular axes, where both, HOMO and LUMO have little or no weight. These images are strongly influenced by low-lying PtPc orbitals that have simple angular structures.</summary>

    <title>Integrating Atomic Layer Deposition and Ultra-High Vacuum Physical Vapor Deposition for In Situ Fabrication of Tunnel Junctions</title>
    <updated>2014-05-05T20:49:26Z</updated>

    <summary>Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a promising technique for growing ultrathin, pristine dielectrics on metal substrates, which is essential to many electronic devices. Tunnel junctions are an excellent example which require a leak-free, ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier of typical thickness around 1 nm between two metal electrodes. A challenge in the development of ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier using ALD is controlling the nucleation of dielectrics on metals with minimal formation of native oxides at the metal surface for high-quality interfaces between the tunnel barrier and metal electrodes. This poses a critical need for integrating ALD with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) physical vapor deposition. In order to address these challenges, a viscous-flow ALD chamber was designed and interfaced to an UHV magnetron sputtering chamber via a load lock. A sample transportation system was implemented for in situ sample transfer between the ALD, load lock, and sputtering chambers. Using this integrated ALD-UHV sputtering system, superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Nb/Al/Al2O3/Nb Josephson tunnel junctions were fabricated with tunnel barriers of thickness varied from sub-nm to ~ 1 nm. The suitability of using an Al wetting layer for initiation of the ALD Al2O3 tunnel barrier was investigated with ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. With optimized processing conditions, leak-free SIS tunnel junctions were obtained, demonstrating the viability of this integrated ALD-UHV sputtering system for the fabrication of tunnel junctions and devices comprised of metal-dielectric-metal multilayers.</summary>
