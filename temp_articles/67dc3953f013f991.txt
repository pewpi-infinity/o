    <summary>Entropy changes due to delocalization and decoherence effects should modify the predictions for the cosmological neutrino background (C$ν$B) temperature when one treats neutrino flavors in the framework of composite quantum systems. Assuming that the final stage of neutrino interactions with the $γe^{-}e^{+}$ radiation plasma before decoupling works as a measurement scheme that projects neutrinos into flavor quantum states, the resulting free-streaming neutrinos can be described as a statistical ensemble of flavor-mixed neutrinos. Even not corresponding to an electronic-flavor pure state, after decoupling the statistical ensemble is described by a density matrix that evolves in time with the full Hamiltonian accounting for flavor mixing, momentum delocalization and, in case of an open quantum system approach, decoherence effects. Since the statistical weights, $w$, shall follow the electron elastic scattering cross section rapport given by $0.16\,w_{e} = w_μ = w_τ$, the von-Neumann entropy will deserve some special attention. Depending on the quantum measurement scheme used for quantifying the entropy, mixing associated to dissipative effects can lead to an increasing of the flavor associated von-Neumann entropy for free-streaming neutrinos. The production of von-Neumann entropy mitigates the constraints on the predictions for energy densities and temperatures of a cosmologically evolving isentropic fluid, in this case, the cosmological neutrino background. The effects of entropy changes on the cosmological neutrino temperature are quantified, and the {\em constraint} involving the number of neutrino species, $N_ν \approx 3$, in the phenomenological confront with Big Bang nucleosynthesis parameters is consistently relieved.</summary>

    <summary>An entropy for the scalar variable case, parallel to Havrda-Charvat entropy was introduced by the first author and the properties and its connection to Tsallis non-extensive statistical mechanics and the Mathai pathway model were examined by the authors in previous papers. In the current paper we extend the entropy to cover scalar case, multivariable case, and matrix variate case. Then this measure is optimized under different types of restrictions and a number of models in the multivariable case and matrix variable case are obtained. Connections of these models to problems in statistical, physical, and engineering sciences are also pointed out. An application of the simplest case of the pathway model to the interpretation of solar neutrino data is provided.</summary>

    <title>On The Origin of Neutrino Mass and Mixing in the Standard Model</title>

    <summary>  One can describe cosmological relic neutrinos by adding Lagrange multipliers to the Standard Model Lagrangian for them. The two possible Lagrange multipliers are a chemical potential, which fixes the mean neutrino/anti-neutrino asymmetry, and a Majorana mass, which fixes the mean spin-entropy. Because these neutrinos originated from a thermal bath, their entropy should be maximal, implying that each state in the background is a symmetric superposition of a neutrino and anti-neutrino. Therefore the Standard Model must be augmented by a flavor-diagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix. This impacts the propagator via tadpole diagrams due to self-interactions. In the low-energy limit, neutrino self-interactions are entirely off-diagonal because same-flavor four-fermion operators vanish by Pauli exclusion. These interactions must be diagonalized when propagating through a bath of neutrinos, using the U(3) global flavor symmetry. U(3) gets broken broken down to SO(3) by Majorana masses, and down to $A_4$ if the three masses are different. Thus our universe today contains tri-bimaximal mixing and Majorana neutrinos. Neutrino mixing is due to the mismatch between the flavor-diagonal Majorana mass matrix arising at finite density and the self-interaction diagonal finite density propagator. The mass hierarchy is inverted and Majorana phases are absent. Lepton number is conserved and the neutrino-less double beta decay experiment absorbs a pair of neutrinos from the relic background and will prove their Majorana nature.</summary>
