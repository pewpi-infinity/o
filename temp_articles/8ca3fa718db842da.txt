    <summary>  It is suggested that charged tachyons of extremely large mass M could not only contribute to the dark matter needed to fit astrophysical observations, but could also provide an explanation for gamma ray bursts and ulta high energy cosmic rays. The present paper defines a quantum field theory of tachyons, particles similar to ordinary leptons, but with momenta larger than energy. The theory is invariant under the full CPT transformation, but separately violates P and T invariance. Micro causality is broken for space-time intervals smaller than 1/M, but is effectively preserved for larger separations. Charged fermionic, rather than charged scalar tachyons are considered in order to minimize the probability of Cerenkov-like radiation by the tachyon, thereby permitting a high energy tachyon to retain its energy over galactic distances. Topics treated include the choice and Schwinger Action Principle variations of an appropriate Lagrangian, spinorial wave functions, relevant Green's functions, a functional description of an S-Matrix and generating functional, and a variety of interesting kinematical processes, including photon emission and reabsorption, and relevant annihilation and scattering effects. A version of Ehrenfest's theorem is developed, in order to provide a foundation for a classical description of charged tachyons in an external electromagnetic field. Applications are then made to three outstanding astrophysical puzzles : dark matter, gamma ray bursts and ultra high energy cosmic rays.</summary>

    <title>Dynamical System Analysis of Randall-Sundrum Model with Tachyon Field on the Brane</title>

    <summary>In this manuscript we use the dynamical system approach to study the linear dynamics of a Randall-Sundrum braneworld model with a tachyon scalar field confined to the brane. We recognize that the form of the tachyon potential plays a significant role in the evolution of the universe. For the case of an inverse square potential we find that one of our new variables, $λ$, is constant. We obtain critical points of the system in this situation and investigate their stability using the linear perturbation method. Then we turn to a Gaussian potential in which $λ$ is not constant. Using the idea of instantaneous critical points we study the behavior of the universe and its possible fates. One of the interesting results of this manuscript is that our universe will probably experience another phase transition from acceleration to deceleration in the future.</summary>

    <title>Instantons near a tachyonic top in anti de Sitter and the no-boundary regulator</title>

    <summary>We investigate instantons near a tachyonic top in an anti de Sitter (AdS) background. If the mass scale around the hill-top is above the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound, then the top is classically stable. When the BF bound is satisfied, it is already known that there can exist instantons with a non-zero probability, though fine-tunings of the potential are required. On the other hand, we may consider a possibility to obtain instantons with a non-zero probability for more natural shape of potentials. We found that the no-boundary regulator is useful to assign a non-zero probability for general instantons near the tachyonic top with a consistent framework. To use the no-boundary regulator, we need to introduce the complexification of fields. One interesting feature is that, for these AdS instantons, the classicality may not be satisfied after the Wick rotation and hence after the nucleation. This magnifies a novel difference between dS and AdS; a semi-classical boundary observer in AdS may notice the dispersion of quantum fields as a kind of uncertainty, while every semi-classical observers in dS are classicalized individually and hence there is no semi-classical observer who can see the quantum dispersion of the scalar field.</summary>
