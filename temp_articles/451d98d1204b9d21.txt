    <summary>In this paper, a phase-space description of electron-positron pair-creation will be applied, based on a Wigner transformation of the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting theory is similar in many respects to the equations from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. However, in the former case, all physics related to particle spin is neglected. In the present paper we compare the pair-production rate in vacuum and plasmas, with and without spin effects, in order to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the spinless approximation. It is found that for modest frequencies of the electromagnetic field, the pair production rate of the Klein-Gordon theory is a good approximation to the Dirac theory, provided the matter density is small enough for Pauli blocking to be neglected, and a factor of two related to the difference in the vacuum energy density is compensated for.</summary>

    <summary>Magnetars are potential energy sources or central engines for numerous transient phenomena in the Universe. How newborn magnetars evolve in different environments remains an open question. Based on both observed and candidate magnetars, it is found that the periods of all magnetars or candidates appear as a bimodal distribution, and are defined as the ``long-P'' and ``short-P'' magnetar subclasses, respectively. We find that for the ``short-P'' subclass of magnetars, the $\dot{P}$ values also appear as a bimodal distribution, and therefore can be classified as ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to generate synthetic magnetar populations and investigate the evolution of the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses by considering both the magnetar spin and inclination, as well as the decay of their magnetic field within their evolution in both vacuum and plasma-filled magnetospheres. We find that the magnetar evolution is dependent on both spin and magnetic field, but seems to be insensitive to inclination evolution and magnetospheric environment for the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' sub-class. In comparison for the case of ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'', the magnetar evolution is dependent on spin, magnetic field, and inclination evolution, as well as the magnetospheric environment. The best evolution model should be the case of inclination evolution in vacuum with a small value of $\overline{\mathrm{FOM}}$. The differences in the best-fit parameters also suggest that the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses may be tracking with different evolution channels.</summary>

    <title>Electromagnetic Waves in the Vacuum with Torsion and Spin</title>

    <summary>  Exact radiative wave solutions to the classical homogeneous Maxwell equations in the vacuum have been found that are not transverse, exhibit both torsion and spin, and for which the second Poincare invariant, E.B, is not zero. Two four component rank 3 tensors of spin current and torsion are constructed on topological grounds. The divergence of each pseudo vector generates the Poincare invariants of the electromagnetic system.</summary>
