    <summary>We investigate the electronic and phonon properties of hydrogen sulfide (SH$_3$) under ultrahigh pressure to elucidate the origin of its high-T$_c$ superconductivity. Contrary to the prevailing belief that the metalized S-H $σ$ bond is responsible, our analysis, based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) calculation, reveals that the H-H $σ$-antibonding states play a dominant role in the large electron-phonon coupling that leads to the superconducting pairing in SH$_3$. Furthermore, by partially restricting the vibration of S atoms, we demonstrate that the S-H bonds provide subsidiary contributions to the pairing interaction. These findings shed light on the importance of the previously overlooked H-H $σ^*$ bonds in driving high-T$_c$ superconductivity in SH$_3$ and offer insights into the relationship between metallic H-H covalent antibonding and high-T$_c$ superconductivity in other hydrogen-rich materials under high pressure.</summary>

    <title>Mechanisms of superconductivity and inhomogeneous states in metallic hydrogen and electron systems with attraction</title>

    <summary>In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</summary>

    <title>Prediction of High Temperature Superconductivity in C2/c-24 Solid Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>Recent experimental developments in hydrogen-rich materials in high pressures have put this class of materials above others in the race toward room temperature superconductivity. As it is the basis of all the materials in this class, the efforts to determine the properties of pure solid hydrogen at high pressures remain intense. Most notably, a recent experimental study of the metallization of hydrogen identified the crystal phase of the solid as the C2/c-24 molecular phase up to ~425 GPa. It is possible that the observed metallization is caused by band structure effects and not a structural phase transition, and the material remains in this crystal phase up to higher pressures. Therefore it is of crucial importance to determine the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24 phase. Here, we employ a Wannier function-based dense k-point and q-point sampling to compute the electron-phonon coupling and superconducting properties of molecular hydrogen in the C2/c-24 phase. We find that the material has a high superconducting transition temperature of 242 K at 500 GPa. We also find that the transition temperature rapidly increases with pressure in the 400 - 500 GPa range.</summary>
