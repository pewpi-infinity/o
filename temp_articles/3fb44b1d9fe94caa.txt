    <summary>The dispersion relation of plasma and plasma-dielectric photonic multilayer structures is approached in terms of a one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulation. For several plasma-dielectric configurations, the system response is obtained using a pulsed excitation and a subsequent two-dimensional frequency analysis. It is first shown that the dispersion relation of a single, homogeneous plasma slab is well described by the cold-plasma model even at low pressures of 1 Pa. The study is extended to the simulation of plasma photonic crystals with a variety of configurations, based on the work of Hojo and Mase [J. Plasma Fusion Res. 80, 89 (2004)]. Considering a one-dimensional plasma photonic crystal made from alternating layers of dielectric and homogeneous plasma slabs, it is shown that the assumption of a cold-plasma description is well justified also in this case. Moreover, in this work the results are reformatted and analyzed in a band diagram representation, in particular based on the lattice constant $a$. Based on these considerations a scaling invariant representation is presented, utilizing a generalized set of parameters. The study is completed with an exemplary comparison of three plasma-dielectric photonic crystal configurations and their corresponding band diagrams.</summary>

    <title>Spatially modulated plasma profile for turbulence and instabilities mitigation in fusion plasma</title>

    <summary>This work explores a novel approach to mitigating turbulence in fusion plasmas through spatially modulated plasma profiles. By imposing a harmonic modulation on plasma parameters, we introduce conditions that alter the propagation characteristics of turbulent and MHD waves, a primary source of transport and instabilities in fusion devices. This modulation approach resembles bandgap formation in solid-state and photonic crystals, where spatial periodicity suppresses wave propagation within specific frequency bands. The mathematical framework developed here essentially resembles the parametric resonance of the harmonic oscillator. It reveals how a controlled spatial variation of turbulent wave phase velocity can effectively attenuate turbulence and instabilities. Several methods for implementing this modulation in plasma, including RF waves, static magnetic field perturbations, and modulated density profiles, are proposed as potential paths for achieving stable confinement. This concept could provide a versatile and potentially more controllable alternative to existing turbulence suppression techniques, with the goal of improving stability and confinement across a variety of magnetized fusion configurations.</summary>

    <title>Fluorine doping: A feasible solution to enhancing the conductivity of high-resistance wide bandgap Mg0.51Zn0.49O active components</title>

    <summary>N-type doping of high-resistance wide bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite high-Mg-content MgxZn1-xO for instance, has always been a fundamental application-motivated research issue. Herein, we report a solution to enhancing the conductivity of high-resistance Mg0.51Zn0.49O active components, which has been reliably achieved by fluorine doping via radio-frequency plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxial growth. Fluorine dopants were demonstrated to be effective donors in Mg0.51Zn0.49O single crystal film having a solar-blind 4.43 eV bandgap, with an average concentration of 1.0E19 F/cm3.The dramatically increased carrier concentration (2.85E17 cm-3 vs ~1014 cm-3) and decreased resistivity (129 ohm.cm vs ~10E6 ohm cm) indicate that the electrical properties of semi-insulating Mg0.51Zn0.49O film can be delicately regulated by F doping. Interestingly, two donor levels (17 meV and 74 meV) associated with F were revealed by temperature-dependent Hall measurements. A Schottky type metal-semiconductor-metal ultraviolet photodetector manifests a remarkably enhanced photocurrent, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the undoped counterpart. The responsivity is greatly enhanced from 0.34 mA/W to 52 mA/W under 10 V bias. The detectivity increases from 1.89E9 cm Hz1/2/W to 3.58eE10 cm Hz1/2/W under 10 V bias at room temperature.These results exhibit F doping serves as a promising pathway for improving the performance of high-Mg-content MgxZn1-xO-based devices.</summary>
