    <summary>The application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with a toroidal mode number of n=4 or n=6 to lower single null plasmas in the MAST tokamak produces up to a factor of 5 increase in Edge Localized Mode (ELM) frequency and reduction in plasma energy loss associated with type-I ELMs. A threshold current for ELM mitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately linearly with current in the coils. Despite a large scan of parameters, complete ELM suppression has not been achieved. The results have been compared to modelling performed using either the vacuum approximation or including the plasma response. During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these lobes is correlated with the increase in ELM frequency observed. The characteristics of the mitigated ELMs are similar to those of the natural ELMs suggesting that they are type I ELMs which are triggered at a lower pressure gradient. The application of the RMPs in the n=4 and n=6 configurations before the L-H transition has little effect on the power required to achieve H-mode while still allowing the first ELM to be mitigated.</summary>

    <title>Adding high time resolution to charge-state-specific ion energy measurements for pulsed copper vacuum arc plasmas</title>

    <summary>Charge-state-resolved ion energy-time-distributions of pulsed Cu arc plasma were obtained by using direct (time dependent) acquisition of the ion detection signal from a commercial ion mass-per-charge and energy-per-charge analyzer. We find a shift of energies of Cu2+, Cu3+ and Cu4+ ions to lower values during the first few hundred microseconds after arc ignition, which is evidence for particle collisions in the plasma. The generation of Cu1+ ions in the later part of the pulse, measured by the increase of Cu1+ signal intensity and an associated slight reduction of the mean charge state point to charge exchange reactions between ions and neutrals. At the very beginning of the pulse, when the plasma expands into vacuum and the plasma potential strongly fluctuates, ions with much higher energy (over 200 eV) were observed. Early in the pulse, the ion energies observed are approximately proportional to the ion charge state, and we conclude that the acceleration mechanism is primarily based on acceleration in an electric field. This field is directed away from the cathode, indicative for a potential hump. Measurements by a floating probe suggest that potential structures travel and ions moving in the traveling field can gain high energies up to a few hundred electron-volt. Later in the pulse, the approximate proportionality is lost, which is either related to increased smearing out of different energies due to collisions with neutrals, and/or a change of the acceleration character from electrostatic to "gas-dynamic", i.e., dominated by pressure gradient.</summary>

    <title>Quantum electrodynamical modes in pair plasmas</title>

    <summary>  We predict the existence of new nonlinear electromagnetic wave modes in pair plasmas. The plasma may be either non-magnetized or immersed in an external magnetic field. The existence of these modes depends on the interaction of an intense circularly polarized electromagnetic wave with a plasma, where the nonlinear quantum vacuum effects are taken into account. This gives rise to new couplings between matter and radiation. We focus on pair plasmas, since the new modes are expected to exist in highly energetic environments, such as pulsar magnetospheres and the next generation of laser--plasma systems.</summary>
