    <summary>  Using coupled equations for the bosonic and fermionic order parameters, we construct families of gap solitons (GSs) in a nearly one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture trapped in a periodic optical-lattice (OL) potential, the boson and fermion components being in the states of the BEC and BCS superfluid, respectively. Fundamental GSs are compact states trapped, essentially, in a single cell of the lattice. Full families of such solutions are constructed in the first two bandgaps of the OL-induced spectrum, by means of variational and numerical methods, which are found to be in good agreement. The families include both intra-gap and inter-gap solitons, with the chemical potentials of the boson and fermion components falling in the same or different bandgaps, respectively.Nonfundamental states, extended over several lattice cells, are constructed too. The GSs are stable against strong perturbations.</summary>

    <title>Evidence for excitonic insulator ground state in triangulene Kagome lattice</title>

    <summary>Electron-hole pair excitations in semiconductors have been predicted to be able to give rise to a highly correlated many-body ground state, the excitonic insulator (EI). Under appropriate conditions below a critical temperature (Tc), strongly bound electron-hole pairs spontaneously form and undergo a phase transition from a normal band insulator into an exciton condensate, transforming the parent material into a novel correlated insulator. Despite recent advances in spectroscopic tools, clear direct experimental evidence for the EI state has been elusive and is often obfuscated by accompanying electronic effects. Here we present the reticular bottom-up synthesis of a Kagome lattice of [4]triangulene, a two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic framework (COF) imbued with a deliberate excitonic instability excitons with binding energies larger than the bandgap arising from a pair of flat bands (FBs). Theoretical analyses based on first-principles calculations and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) reveal quasiparticle spectral signatures mixing valence (VB) and conduction (CB) characteristics of the FBs along with a non-trivial semiconducting gap that can only be explained by invoking many-body theory. Our findings spectroscopically corroborate the nature of a FB induced exciton insulator ground state and provide a robust yet highly tuneable platform for the exploration of correlated quasi boson physics in quantum materials.</summary>

    <title>Symbiotic two-component gap solitons</title>

    <summary>We consider a two-component one-dimensional model of gap solitons (GSs), which is based on two nonlinear Schrödinger equations, coupled by repulsive XPM (cross-phase-modulation) terms, in the absence of the SPM (self-phase-modulation) nonlinearity. The equations include a periodic potential acting on both components, thus giving rise to GSs of the "symbiotic" type, which exist solely due to the repulsive interaction between the two components. The model may be implemented for "holographic solitons" in optics, and in binary bosonic or fermionic gases trapped in the optical lattice. Fundamental symbiotic GSs are constructed, and their stability is investigated, in the first two finite bandgaps of the underlying spectrum. Symmetric solitons are destabilized, including their entire family in the second bandgap, by symmetry-breaking perturbations above a critical value of the total power. Asymmetric solitons of intra-gap and inter-gap types are studied too, with the propagation constants of the two components falling into the same or different bandgaps, respectively. The increase of the asymmetry between the components leads to shrinkage of the stability areas of the GSs. Inter-gap GSs are stable only in a strongly asymmetric form, in which the first-bandgap component is a dominating one. Intra-gap solitons are unstable in the second bandgap. Unstable two-component GSs are transformed into persistent breathers. In addition to systematic numerical considerations, analytical results are obtained by means of an extended ("tailed") Thomas-Fermi approximation (TFA).</summary>
