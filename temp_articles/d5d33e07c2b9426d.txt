    <summary>Airy wavefunctions are associated with one of the simplest scenarios in wave mechanics: a quantum bouncing ball. In other words, they are the eigenstates of the time-independent Schrodinger equation with a linear potential. In the domain of optics, laser beams that are spatially shaped as Airy functions (`Airy beams') have been shown to exhibit a prominent lobe that follows a curved path, rather than propagating in a straight line, and which has self-healing properties in the presence of obstacles. Here, we observe the presence of Airy resonances in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a lattice of holes in a silicon slab. Analogously to electrons in a linear potential, these Airy resonances arise due to a linear spatial variation in the lattice constant of the holes. We map the electromagnetic description of the photonic crystal onto a 2D non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation with a linear potential, which we call a `superpotential'. The non-Hermiticity appears in the form of a complex effective mass due to out-of-plane radiation and fundamentally alters the collective optical response of the Airy resonances.</summary>

    <title>Pseudo-Resonance and Energy Band Gap in Plasmonic Crystals</title>

    <summary>In this paper, using the generalized coupled pseudoforce model with driving elements, we develop a method to study the plasmon excitations and energy band structure in a plasmonic crystal. It is shown that the presence of the periodic ion core potential leads to pseudo-resonance condition in the plasmon wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles, quite analogous to the frequency resonance, leading to the gap formation in the energy dispersion profiles. It is found that the dual length scale character of plasmon excitations lead to occurrence of a critical value of $a_c=2πλ_p$ for the lattice constant ($λ_p$ being the plasmon wavelength) above and below which the energy band structure of plasmonic crystals becomes substantially different. It is also found that energy band gap positions of parabolic free electron energy dispersion relation are slightly higher compared to that of the plasmon excitations. Here based on the plasmon definition and due to the dual length scale character of plasmons compared to that of single electrons, we provide a simplified interpretation of the wave-particle duality in quantum physics and provide the length scale regime in which both wave and particle properties can be simultaneously examined in a single experiment, where, the complementarity principle breaks down. However, the dual characteristics of electron-plasmon coupled excitations, quite analogous to starling murmuration phenomenon, strongly suggests that the long south de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave of electron is nothing but the plasmon itself. The wavefunction and electrostatic potential solution for a one dimensional plasmonic lattice with a generalized periodic potential is also derived in this research.</summary>

    <title>Light Induced Electron Spin Resonance Properties of van der Waals CrX3 (X = Cl, I) Crystals</title>

    <summary>The research on layered van der Waals (vdW) magnets is rapidly progressing owing to exciting fundamental science and potential applications. In bulk crystal form, CrCl3 is a vdW antiferromagnet with in-plane ferromagnetic ordering below 17 K, and CrI3 is a vdW ferromagnet below 61 K. Here, we report on the electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of CrCl3 and CrI3 single crystals upon photo-excitation in the visible range. We noticed remarkable changes in the ESR spectra upon illumination. In the case of CrCl3, at 10 K, the ESR signal is shifted from g = 1.492 (dark) to 1.661 (light), line width increased from 376 to 506 Oe, and the signal intensity is reduced by 1.5 times. Most interestingly, the observed change in the signal intensity is reversible when the light is cycled on/off. We observed almost no change in the ESR spectral parameters in the paramagnetic phase (&gt;20 K) upon illumination. Upon photo-excitation of CrI3, the ESR signal intensity is reduced by 1.9 times; the g-value increased from 1.956 to 1.990; the linewidth increased from 1170 to 1260 Oe at 60 K. These findings are discussed by taking into account the skin depth, the slow relaxation mechanism and the appearance of low-symmetry fields at the photo-generated Cr2+ Jahn-Teller centers. Such an increase in the g-value as a result of photo-generated Cr2+ ions is further supported by our many-body wavefunction calculations. This work has the potential to extend to monolayer vdWs magnets by combining ESR spectroscopy with optical excitation and detection.</summary>
