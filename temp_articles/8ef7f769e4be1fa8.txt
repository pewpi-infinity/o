    <summary>We report nanocrystalline carbon impurities coexisting with graphene synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on platinum. We observe micron-size island-like impurity layers, which can easily be mistaken for second graphene layers in optical microscopy or secondary electron microscopy (SEM). The island orientation depends on the crystalline orientation of the Pt, as shown by electron backscatter diffraction(EBSD), indicating growth of amorphous carbon below graphene. Dark-field TEM indicates that in addition to uniform single-crystal graphene, our sample is decorated with nanocrystalline carbon impurities with a spatially inhomogeneous distribution. Raman spectra show a large D peak, however electrical characterization shows high mobility (~6,000 cm2/Vs), indicating a limitation for Raman spectroscopy in characterizing the electronic quality of graphene.</summary>

    <title>Dominant Kinetic Pathways of Graphene Growth in Chemical Vapor Deposition: The Role of Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>The most popular way to produce graphene nowadays is chemical vapor deposition, where, surprisingly, H$_2$ gas is routinely supplied even though it is a byproduct itself. In this study, by identifying dominant growing pathways via multiscale simulations, we unambiguously reveal the central role hydrogen played in graphene growth. Hydrogen can saturate the edges of a growing graphene island to some extent, depending on the H$_2$ pressure. Although graphene etching by hydrogen has been observed in experiment, hydrogen saturation actually stabilizes graphene edges by reducing the detachment rates of carbon-contained species. Such a new picture well explains some puzzling experimental observations and is also instrumental in growth protocol optimization for two-dimensional atomic crystal van der Waals epitaxy.</summary>

    <title>Influence of Chemisorbed Oxygen on the Growth of Graphene on Cu(100) by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>

    <summary>Understanding the influence that copper substrate surface symmetry and oxygen impurities have on the growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition is important for developing techniques for producing high quality graphene. Therefore, we have studied the growth of graphene by catalytic decomposition of ethylene in an ultra-high vacuum chamber on both a clean Cu(100) surface and a Cu(100) surface pre-dosed with a layer of chemisorbed oxygen. The crystal structure of the graphene films was characterized with \emph{in-situ} low energy electron diffraction. By heating the clean Cu(100) substrate from room temperature to the growth temperature in ethylene, epitaxial graphene films were formed. The crystal quality was found to depend strongly on the growth temperature. At 900 $^\circ$C, well-ordered two-domain graphene films were formed. Pre-dosing the Cu(100) surface with a chemisorbed layer of oxygen before graphene growth was found to adversely affect the crystal quality of the graphene overlayer by inducing a much higher degree of rotational disorder of the graphene grains with respect to the Cu(100) substrate. The growth morphology of the graphene islands during the initial stages of nucleation was monitored with \emph{ex-situ} scanning electron microscopy. The nucleation rate of the graphene islands was observed to drop by an order of magnitude by pre-dosing the Cu(100) surface with a chemisorbed oxygen layer before growth. This reduction in nucleation rate results in the formation of much larger graphene islands. Therefore, the presence of oxygen during graphene growth affects both the relative orientation and average size of grains within the films grown on Cu(100) substrates.</summary>
