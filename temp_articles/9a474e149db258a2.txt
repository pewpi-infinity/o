    <summary>The screening of impurities in plasma with Bose-Einstein condensate of electrically charged bosons is considered. It is shown that the screened potential is drastically different from the usual Debye one. The polarization operator of photons in plasma acquires infrared singular terms at small photon momentum and the screened potential drops down as a power of distance and even has an oscillating behavior, similar to the Friedel oscillations in plasma with degenerate fermions. The magnetic properties of the cosmological plasma with condensed W-bosons are also discussed. It is shown that W-bosons condense in the ferromagnetic state. It could lead to spontaneous magnetization of the primeval plasma. The created magnetic fields may seed galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields observed in the present-day universe.</summary>

    <summary>  We calculate the imaginary part of the retarded two-loop self-energy of a static vector boson in a plasma of quarks and gluons of temperature T, using the imaginary time formalism. We recombine various cuts of the self-energy to generate physical processes. We demonstrate how cuts containing loops may be reinterpreted in terms of interference between Order $α$ tree diagrams and the Born term along with spectators from the medium. We apply our results to the rate of dilepton production in the limit of dilepton invariant mass E&gt;&gt;T. We find that all infrared and collinear singularities cancel in the final result obtained in this limit.</summary>

    <title>Diagrammatic and Kinetic Equation Analysis of Ultrasoft Fermionic Sector in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

    <summary>At so high temperature (T) that the coupling constant (g) is small and the masses of the particles are negligible, different scheme has to be applied in each energy scale in the analysis of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In the soft energy region (p gT), the simple perturbative expansion called the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation can be applied, and that approximation expects the existence of the bosonic and fermionic collective excitations called plasmon and plasmino. On the other hand, in the ultrasoft energy region (p g^2T), the HTL approximation is inapplicable due to infrared singularity, so the question whether there are any excitation modes in that energy region has not been studied well. In this thesis, we analyze the quark spectrum whose energy is ultrasoft in QGP, using the resummed perturbation theory which enables us to successfully regularize the infrared singularity. Since the Yukawa model and QED are simpler than QCD but have some similarity to QCD, we also work in these models. As a result, we establish the existence of a novel fermionic mode in the ultrasoft energy region, and obtain the expressions of the pole position and the strength of that mode. We also show that the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the resummed perturbation theory in QED/QCD. Furthermore, we derive the linearized and generalized Boltzmann equation for the ultrasoft fermion excitations in the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, and show that the resultant equation is equivalent to the self-consistent equation in the resummed perturbation theory. We also derive the equation which determines the n-point functions with external lines for a pair of fermions and (n-2) bosons with ultrasoft momenta, by considering the non-linear response regime using the gauge symmetry. We also derive the Ward-Takahashi identity from the conservation law of the electromagnetic current in the Kadanoff-Baym formalism.</summary>
