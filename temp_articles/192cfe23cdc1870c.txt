    <summary>The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of finite ultracold bosonic ensembles in periodically driven one-dimensional optical lattices is investigated. Our study reveals that the driving enforces the bosons in different wells to oscillate in-phase and to exhibit a dipole-like mode. A wide range from weak-to-strong driving frequencies is covered and a resonance-like behaviour of the intra-well dynamics is discussed. In the proximity of the resonance a rich intraband excitation spectrum is observed. The single particle excitation mechanisms are studied in the framework of Floquet theory elucidating the role of the driving frequency. The impact of the interatomic repulsive interactions is examined in detail yielding a strong influence on the tunneling period and the excitation probabilities. Finally, the dependence of the resonance upon a variation of the tunable parameters of the optical lattice is examined. Our analysis is based on the ab-initio Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree Method for bosons.</summary>

    <summary>The results on the so-called $^8$Be anomaly, recently corroborated by similar experimental evidence in the radiative transitions of excited $^4$He nuclei, could be justified by the creation of a new particle with a mass of $m_X\simeq16.7$ MeV/$c^2$. The PADME experiment, designed for searching light dark sector particles, like a dark photon or an axion-like particle, both in $γ+$ missing energy and $e^+ e^-$ final states, has the potential of performing a completely independent search, also exploiting the cross-section enhancement at the resonance $\sqrt{s}\simeq m_X$. In the case of the $X$(17 MeV) boson, this corresponds to a positron energy of 282 MeV when annihilating on electrons at rest. In order to keep the pile-up and the over-veto probabilities under control, the positron beam hitting the PADME active target should be as much diluted in time as possible. PADME has already collected a first data-set at the Frascati beam-test facility, using the positron beam accelerated by the DA$Φ$NE LINAC, with maximum length of $\sim$200 ns and energy 490-550 MeV. In this note, the possible modifications to the RF system of the LINAC, aiming at further extending the pulse length at the expenses of the maximum beam energy, are briefly discussed.</summary>

    <summary>We unravel the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of a few interacting bosonic clouds in a two-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential at the resonant tunneling scenario. At the single-particle level of resonant tunneling, particles tunnel under the barrier from, typically, the ground-state in the left well to an excited state in the right well, i.e., states of different shapes and properties are coupled when their one-particle energies coincide. In two spatial dimensions, two types of resonant tunneling processes are possible, to which we refer to as longitudinal and transversal resonant tunneling. Longitudinal resonant tunneling implies that the state in the right well is longitudinally-excited with respect to the state in the left well, whereas transversal resonant tunneling implies that the former is transversely-excited with respect to the latter. We show that interaction between bosons makes resonant tunneling phenomena in two spatial dimensions profoundly rich, and analyze these phenomena in terms of the loss of coherence of the junction and development of fragmentation, and coupling between transverse and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom and excitations. To this end, a detailed analysis of the tunneling dynamics is performed by exploring the time evolution of a few physical quantities, namely, the survival probability, occupation numbers of the reduced one-particle density matrix, and the many-particle position, momentum, and angular-momentum variances. In general, we display the impact of the transversal and longitudinal degrees-of-freedom in the many-boson tunneling dynamics at the resonant tunneling scenarios.</summary>
