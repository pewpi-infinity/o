    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>

    <title>Experimentally Constrained Molecular Relaxation: The case of hydrogenated amorphous silicon</title>

    <summary>  We have extended our experimentally constrained molecular relaxation technique (P. Biswas {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 71} 54204 (2005)) to hydrogenated amorphous silicon: a 540-atom model with 7.4 % hydrogen and a 611-atom model with 22 % hydrogen were constructed. Starting from a random configuration, using physically relevant constraints, {\it ab initio} interactions and the experimental static structure factor, we construct realistic models of hydrogenated amorphous silicon. Our models confirm the presence of a high frequency localized band in the vibrational density of states due to Si-H vibration that has been observed in a recent vibrational transient grating measurements on plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited films of hydrogenated amorphous silicon.</summary>

    <title>The effect of nitriding on the humidity sensing properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon films</title>

    <summary>We have studied the effect of nitriding on the humidity sensing properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films. The films were prepared in two stages combining the techniques of physical deposition in vapor phase evaporation (PAPVD) and plasma pulsed nitriding. By deconvolution of the Raman spectrum we identified two peaks corresponding to the D and G modes characteristic of a-C:H. After the N$_2$-H$_2$ plasma treating, the peaks narrowed and shifted to the right, which we associated with the incorporation of N into the structure. We compared the sensitivity to the relative humidity (RH) of the films before and after the N$_2$-H$_2$ plasma treatment. The nitriding improved the humidity sensitivity measured as the low frequency resistance.
  By impedance spectroscopy we studied the frequency dependence of the AC conductivity $σ$ at different RH conditions. Before nitriding $σ(ω)\sim A ω^s$, it seemed to have the universal behaviour seen in other amorphous systems. The humidity changed the overall scale $A$. After nitriding, the exponent $s$ increased, and became RH dependent. We associated this behaviour to the change of the interaction mechanism between the water molecule and the substrate when the samples were nitriding.</summary>
