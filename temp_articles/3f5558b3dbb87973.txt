    <summary>The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</summary>

    <title>Lorentzian Vacuum Transitions in Hořava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>

    <summary>The vacuum transition probabilities for a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker universe with positive curvature in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity in the presence of a scalar field potential in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation are studied. We use a general procedure to compute such transition probabilities using a Hamiltonian approach to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation presented in a previous work. We consider two situations of scalar fields, one in which the scalar field depends on all the spacetime variables and other in which the scalar field depends only on the time variable. In both cases analytic expressions for the vacuum transition probabilities are obtained and the infrared and ultraviolet limits are discussed for comparison with the result obtained by using general relativity. For the case in which the scalar field depends on all spacetime variables we obtain that in the infrared limit it is possible to obtain a similar behavior as in general relativity, however in the ultraviolet limit the behavior found is completely opposite. Some few comments about possible phenomenological implications of our results are given. One of them is a plausible resolution of the initial singularity. On the other hand for the case in which the scalar field depends only on the time variable, the behavior coincides with that of general relativity in both limits, although in the intermediate region the probability is slightly altered.</summary>

    <title>Effects of quantum corrections to Lorentzian vacuum transitions in the presence of gravity</title>

    <summary>We present a study of the vacuum transition probabilities taking into account quantum corrections. We first introduce a general method that expands previous works employing the Lorentzian formalism of the Wheeler-De Witt equation by considering higher order terms in the semiclassical expansion. The method presented is applicable in principle to any model in the minisuperspace and up to any desired order in the quantum correction terms. Then, we apply this method to obtain analytical solutions for the probabilities up to second quantum corrections for homogeneous isotropic and anisotropic universes. We use the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with positive and zero curvature for the isotropic case and the Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs metrics for the anisotropic case. Interpreting the results as distribution probabilities of creating universes by vacuum decay with a given size, we found that the general behaviour is that considering up to the second quantum correction leads to an avoidance of the initial singularity. However, we show that this result can only be achieved for the isotropic universe. Furthermore, we also study the effect of anisotropy on the transition probabilities.</summary>
