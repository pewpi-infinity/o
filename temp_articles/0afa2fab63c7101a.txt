    <summary>Retention of hydrogen isotopes (protium, deuterium and tritium) in tungsten is one of the most severe issues in design of fusion power plants, since significant trapping of tritium may cause exceeding radioactivity safety limits in future reactors. Hydrogen isotopes in tungsten can be detected using the nuclear reaction analysis method in channeling mode (NRA/C). However, the information hidden within the experimental spectra is subject to interpretation. In this work, we propose the methodology to interpret the response of the experimental NRA/C spectra to the specific lattice locations of deuterium by simulations of the NRA/C spectra from atomic structures of deuterium lattice locations as obtained from the first principles calculations. We show that trapping conditions, i.e., states of local crystal structures retaining deuterium, affect the lattice locations of deuterium and the change of lattice locations can be detected by ion channeling method. By analyzing the experimental data, we are able to determine specific information on the deuterium trapping conditions, including the number of deuterium atoms trapped by one vacancy as well as the presence of impurity atoms along with deuterium in vacancies.</summary>

    <summary>Quasicrystals (QCs) are a novel form of matter, which are neither crystalline nor amorphous. Among many surprising properties of QCs is their high catalytic activity. We propose a mechanism explaining this peculiarity based on unusual dynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic vibrations (LAVs) and phasons. In the former case, one deals with a large amplitude (~ fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small group of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as discrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs. On the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are represented by very large amplitude (~angstrom) oscillations of atoms be-tween two quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude atomic motion in LAVs and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons) in case of hydrogenated QCs. This driving may result in the increase of amplitude and energy of zero-point vibrations (ZPV). Based on that, we demonstrate a drastic increase of the D-D or D-H fusion rate with increasing number of modulation periods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account suppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations. In this context, we present numerical solution of Schrodinger equation for a particle in a non-stationary double well potential, which is driven time-periodically imitating the action of a LAV or phason. We show that the rate of tunneling of the particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is enhanced drastically by the driving, and it increases strongly with increasing amplitude of the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs that can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.</summary>

    <title>Intense γ-photon and high-energy electron production by neutron irradiation: effects of nuclear excitations on reactor materials</title>

    <summary>The effects of neutron irradiation on materials are often interpreted in terms of atomic recoils, initiated by neutron impacts and producing crystal lattice defects. In addition, there is a remarkable two-step process, strongly pronounced in the medium-weight and heavy elements. This process involves the generation of energetic γ photons in nonelastic collisions of neutrons with atomic nuclei, achieved via capture and inelastic reactions. Subsequently, high-energy electrons are excited through the scattering of γ photons by the atomic electrons. We derive and validate equations enabling a fast and robust evaluation of photon and electron fluxes produced by the neutrons in the bulk of materials. The two-step n-γ-e scattering creates a nonequilibrium dynamically fluctuating steady-state population of high-energy electrons, with the spectra of photon and electron energies extending well into the mega-electron-volt range. This stimulates vacancy diffusion through electron-triggered atomic recoils, primarily involving vacancy-impurity dissociation, even if thermal activation is ineffective. Tungsten converts the energy of fusion or fission neutrons into a flux of γ radiation at the conversion efficiency approaching 99%, with implications for structural materials, superconductors, and insulators, as well as phenomena like corrosion, and helium and hydrogen isotope retention.</summary>
