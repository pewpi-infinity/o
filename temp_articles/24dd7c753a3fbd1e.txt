    <summary>  Certain configurations of D-branes, for example wrong dimensional branes or the brane-antibrane system, are unstable to decay. This instability is described by the appearance of a tachyonic mode in the spectrum of open strings ending on the brane(s). The decay of these unstable systems is described by the rolling of the tachyon field from the unstable maximum to the minimum of its potential. We analytically study the dynamics of the inhomogeneous tachyon field as it rolls towards the true vacuum of the theory in the context of several different tachyon effective actions. We find that the vacuum dynamics of these theories is remarkably similar and in particular we show that in all cases the tachyon field forms caustics where second and higher derivatives of the field blow up. The formation of caustics signals a pathology in the evolution since each of the effective actions considered is not reliable in the vicinity of a caustic. We speculate that the formation of caustics is an artifact of truncating the tachyon action, which should contain all orders of derivatives acting on the field, to a finite number of derivatives. Finally, we consider inhomogeneous solutions in p-adic string theory, a toy model of the bosonic tachyon which contains derivatives of all orders acting on the field. For a large class of initial conditions we conclusively show that the evolution is well behaved in this case. It is unclear if these caustics are a genuine prediction of string theory or not.</summary>

    <title>Homotopy Operators and One-Loop Vacuum Energy at the Tachyon Vacuum</title>

    <summary>We construct the homotopy operators for the BRST operator in the theory around the identity-based solutions, which are believed to represent the tachyon vacuum in cubic bosonic open string field theory. Using the homotopy operators, we find that the one-loop vacuum energy at the tachyon vacuum is independent of moduli such as interbrane distances, which are included in the BRST operator. We also revisit the cohomology problem, which was solved earlier without the homotopy operators.</summary>

    <title>Tachyon Vacuum of Bosonic Open String Field Theory in Marginally Deformed Backgrounds</title>

    <summary>We consider bosonic open string field theory in marginally deformed backgrounds, which is obtained by expanding the string field around the identity-based solutions associated with marginal deformations. We find a new set of string fields which satisfies the KBc algebra, but the nilpotent kinetic operator is that of the theory expanded around the identity-based marginal solution. By use of these string fields, we construct the tachyon vaccum solution in marginally deformed backgrounds. The vacuum energy density is equivalent to that of the tachyon vacuum without marginal deformations. The gauge invariant overlap is changed according to the effect of marginal deformations, as expected from known results in CFT. These results suggest that the vacuum energy is zero for the identity-based marginal solutions in the original theory.</summary>
