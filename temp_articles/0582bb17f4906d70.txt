    <summary>  The kinematics of neutral gas and warm ionized gas have been mapped in one-dimension across ultraluminous starburst galaxies using interstellar absorption and emission lines, in Keck II ESI spectra. Blue-shifted absorption is found along more of the slit than anticipated, exceeding scales of 15 kpc across several systems. The large velocity gradient measured across some of these outflows is inconsistent with a flow diverging from the central starburst -- angular momentum conservation reduces the rotational velocity of an outflow as it expands. More widespread star formation, likely triggered by the merger, probably drives these outflows, although some models suggest the collision itself could generate a wind by shock heating interstellar gas throughout the disk. Young mergers with separated nuclei present the highest outflow masses, due mainly to the larger area over which the cool gas can be detected. In a typical ULIG, the mass carried by the cool phase of the outflow is around 10^8Msun, or a few percent of the total dynamical mass. Assuming the starburst activity has proceeded at the observed rate for the past 10 Myr, the kinetic energy of the cool outflows is a few percent of the supernova energy, consistent with starbursts powering the outflows. The cool wind is expected to be accelerated by momentum deposition, possibly from radiation pressure as well as supernovae. Such models imply turn-around radii for the cool outflows of at least 30 to 90 kpc. This cross-section presents a significant NaI absorption cross section. If most L &gt; 0.1L* galaxies pass through a luminous starburst phase, then relics of cool outflows will create a significant redshift-path density. Galaxy formation models should include this cool phase of the outflow in addition to a hot wind in feedback models.</summary>

    <title>The Impact of Star Formation on the Interstellar Medium in Dwarf Galaxies: II. The Formation of Galactic Winds</title>

    <summary>  Images and longslit, echelle spectra of the \Ha emission from 14 dwarf galaxies and M82 have been used to identify expanding shells of ionized gas. Supershells (radius $&gt;~300$ pc) are found in 12 of the dwarfs. The measured shell sizes and expansion speeds constrain the ages and power requirements of the bubbles. The dynamical age of the larger bubbles is typically about 10 Myr, and ionized shells older than 20 Myr are rare. An energy equivalent to 100 to 10,000 supernova explosions over this period is needed to drive the shock front that sweeps out the cavity. The current star formation rates are high enough to meet these power requirements. Many of the shells will breakthrough the surrounding layer of HI lower limits on the escape velocity. Some of the shell material may permanently escape from a few galaxies such as NGC1569. Whether bound to the galaxy or not, these outflows probably play an important role in regulating the star formation rate and are expected to significantly influence the chemical evolution of the galaxies. The shells lift gas out of the disk at rates comparable to, or even greater than, the current galactic star formation rates. They will only displace a substantial fraction of the interstellar gas if their duty cycle is much longer than the rotational period of the disk.</summary>

    <title>IRAS 16293-2422: proper motions, jet precession, the hot core, and the unambiguous detection of infall</title>

    <summary>  We present observations of IRAS 16293-2422 using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 300 GHz, and the Very Large Array (VLA) at frequencies from 1.5 to 43 GHz. This source was already known to be a binary system with components A and B separated by ~5". The new SMA data now separate source A into two submm continuum components, denoted Aa and Ab. The strongest of these, Aa, peaks between the cm radio sources A1 and A2. Archival VLA data show proper motion of sources A and B of 17 mas/yr, associated with motion of the rho Ophiuchi cloud. We also find relative motion between A1 and A2 which excludes the possibility that they are gravitationally bound. A2 remains stationary relative to source B, and we identify it as the protostar driving the NE-SW CO outflow. A1 is shock-ionized gas where a precessing jet interacts with dense gas. This jet probably drives the E-W CO outflow. The origin of this jet must be located close to A2, and may be the submm source Aa. Thus source A is now shown to comprise three components within 1". Source B, however, is single, exhibits optically-thick dust emission even at 8 GHz, has a high luminosity, and yet shows no sign of outflow, indicating it is probably very young.
  The SMA spectrum of IRAS 16293-2422 reports the first astronomical identification of many lines at 300 and 310 GHz. The species detected are typical of hot cores, and are mainly associated with source A. We suggest the shock at A1 may explain the enhanced abundances measured, especially of sulphur-bearing molecules. We use the high brightness temperature of the submm dust emission from source B to demonstrate the unambiguous detection of infall by observing redshifted SO (7_7-6_6) absorption against the dust disk.</summary>
