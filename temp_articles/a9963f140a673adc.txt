    <summary>  We study the quantum Hall effect in graphene at filling factors ν= 0 and ν= \pm, concentrating on the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime, within a non-perturbative bosonization formalism. We start by developing a bosonization scheme for electrons with two discrete degrees of freedom (spin-1/2 and pseudospin-1/2) restricted to the lowest Landau level. Three distinct phases are considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin phases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (ν=-1) while the others to a half-filled (ν= 0) lowest Landau level. In each case, we show that the elementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set of n-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of the projected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospin density operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to the effective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms, recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, an effective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations of the elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that the charged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherent state of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson model derived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian and show that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantum Hall skyrmions. We briefly discuss the influence of the SU(4) symmetry breaking terms in the skyrmion energy.</summary>

    <title>Pseudogap and Kinetic Pairing Under Critical Differentiation of Electrons in Cuprate Superconductors</title>

    <summary>  Superconducting mechanism of cuprates is discussed in the light of the proximity of the Mott insulator. The proximity accompanied by suppression of coherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in finite-dimensional systems. Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of such differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general point of view. A typical example of the differentiation is found in the flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta $(π,0)$ and $(0,π)$ on 2D square lattices. This flattening even controls the criticality of the metal-insulator transition. Such differentiation and suppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting state in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. The d-wave pairing interaction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence of disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. The superconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is conceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic excitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms. Pseudogap phenomena widely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from the mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively coupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones. When we assume the existence of a strong d-wave channel repulsively competing with AFM fluctuations under the formation of flat and damped single-particle dispersion, we reproduce basic properties of the pseudogap seen in the magnetic resonance, neutron scattering, angle resolved photoemission and tunneling measurements in the cuprates.</summary>

    <summary>  It is supposed that the electron neutrino mass is related to the structures and masses of the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons. Using a composite model of fermions (described elsewhere), it is shown that the massless neutrino is not consistent with the high values of the experimental masses of $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$. Consistency can be achieved on the assumption that the electron-neutrino has a mass of about 4.5 meV. Masses of the muon- and tau-neutrinos are also estimated.</summary>
