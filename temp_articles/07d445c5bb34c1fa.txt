    <summary>  A QED-based mechanism, breaking translational invariance of the vacuum at sufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for the vacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtual vacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fields corresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_μ^{ext} (x)$, which is itself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_μ(x)$ in the presence of that $A_μ^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equation for $A_μ^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solution corresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; this solution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on the order of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble is included; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_μ$, whose magnitude is determined by a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observed acceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which the fields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysis suggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (corresponding to a "spontaneous vacuum phase change") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a "polarization of the QED vacuum" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum). Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing the possibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whose back-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. The possibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentum transfers is discussed.</summary>

    <summary>  We calculate the effective Lagrangian for a magnetic field in spinor, scalar and vector QED. Connections are then made to $SU(N_C)$ Yang--Mills theory and QCD. The magnetization and the corresponding effective charge are obtained from the effective Lagrangian. The renormalized vacuum magnetization will depend on the renormalization scale chosen. Regardless of this, the effective charge decreasing with the magnetic field, as in QCD, corresponds to anti- screening and asymptotic freedom. In spinor and scalar QED on the other hand, the effective charge is increasing with the magnetic field, corresponding to screening. Including effects due to finite temperature and density, we comment on the effective charge in a degenerate fermion gas, increasing linearly with the chemical potential. Neglecting the tachyonic mode, we find that in hot QCD the effective charge is decreasing as the inverse temperature, in favor for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma. However, including the real part of the contribution from the tachyonic mode, we find instead an effective charge increasing with the temperature. Including a thermal gluon mass, the effective charge in hot QCD is group invariant (unlike in the two cases above), and decreases logarithmically in accordance to the vacuum renormalization group equation, with the temperature as the momentum scale.</summary>

    <title>Instability of bubble expansion at zero temperature</title>

    <summary>In the context of false vacuum decay at zero temperature, it is well known that bubbles expand with uniform proper acceleration. We show that this uniformly accelerating expansion suffers from an instability related to the bubble size. This can be observed in Minkowski spacetime as a tachyonic mode in the spectrum of fluctuations for the energy functional in the reference frame in which the uniformly accelerating bubble wall appears static. In such a frame, arbitrary small perturbations cause an amplifying departure from the static wall solution. This implies that the nucleated bubble is not a critical point of the energy functional in the rest frame of nucleation but becomes one in the accelerating frame. The aforementioned instability for vacuum bubbles can be related to the well-known instability for the nucleated critical static bubbles during finite-temperature phase transitions in the rest frame of the plasma. It is therefore proposed that zero-temperature vacuum decays as seen from accelerating frames have a dual description in terms of finite-temperature phase transitions.</summary>
