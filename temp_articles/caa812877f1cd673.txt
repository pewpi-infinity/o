    <summary>We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</summary>

    <summary>The collision of two expanding plasma clouds is investigated, emphasizing instabilities and electron energization in the plasma mixing layer. This work is directly relevant to laboratory experiments with explosively-created laser or z-pinch plasmas but may also elucidate naturally occurring plasma collisions in astrophysical or space physics contexts. In the previous publications [1,2] we have studied, analytically and numerically, the flow emerging from interpenetrating coronas launched by two parallel wires vaporized in a vacuum chamber. The main foci of the studies have been on the general flow pattern and lower-hybrid and thin-shell instabilities that under certain conditions develop in the collision layer. The present paper centers around the initial phase of the interpenetration of the two plasmas. A two-stream ion-ion instability, efficient electron heating, and stochastic acceleration dominate plasma mixing at this phase. Both the adiabatic (reversible) electron heating and stochastic (irreversible) acceleration and heating mechanisms, powered by unstably driven electric fields, are considered. The irreversibility results from a combination of electron runaway acceleration in the wave electric fields and pitch-angle scattering on ions and neutrals.</summary>

    <title>On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma</title>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>
