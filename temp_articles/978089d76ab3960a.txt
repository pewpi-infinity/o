    <summary>Graphene nanoribbon (GNR) field-effect transistors (FETs) with widths down to 12 nm have been fabricated by electron beam lithography using a wafer-scale chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to form the graphene. The GNR FETs show drain-current modulation of approximately 10 at 300 K, increasing to nearly 106 at 4 K. The strong temperature dependence of the minimum current indicates the opening of a bandgap for CVD-grown GNR-FETs. The extracted bandgap is estimated to be around 0.1 eV by differential conductance methods. This work highlights the development of CVD-grown large-area graphene and demonstrates the opening of a bandgap in nanoribbon transistors.</summary>

    <title>Wafer Scale Homogeneous Bilayer Graphene Films by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>

    <summary>The discovery of electric field induced bandgap opening in bilayer graphene opens new door for making semiconducting graphene without aggressive size scaling or using expensive substrates. However, bilayer graphene samples have been limited to um size scale thus far, and synthesis of wafer scale bilayer graphene posts tremendous challenge. Here we report homogeneous bilayer graphene films over at least 2 inch x 2 inch area, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition on copper foil and subsequently transferred to arbitrary substrates. The bilayer nature of graphene film is verified by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Importantly, spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy confirms a bilayer coverage of over 99%. The homogeneity of the film is further supported by electrical transport measurements on dual-gate bilayer graphene transistors, in which bandgap opening is observed in 98% of the devices.</summary>

    <title>Graphene Field Effect Transistors: A Review</title>

    <summary>The past decade has seen rapid growth in the research area of graphene and its application to novel electronics. With Moore's law beginning to plateau, the need for post-silicon technology in industry is becoming more apparent. Moreover, existing technology is insufficient for implementing terahertz detectors and receivers, which are required for a number of applications including medical imaging and security scanning. Graphene is considered to be a key potential candidate for replacing silicon in existing CMOS technology as well as realizing field effect transistors for terahertz detection, due to its remarkable electronic properties, with observed electronic mobilities reaching up to $2 \times 10^5$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ in suspended graphene samples. This report reviews the physics and electronic properties of graphene in the context of graphene transistor implementations. Common techniques used to synthesize graphene, such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and epitaxial growth are reviewed and compared. One of the challenges associated with realizing graphene transistors is that graphene is semimetallic, with a zero bandgap, which is troublesome in the context of digital electronics applications. Thus, the report also reviews different ways of opening a bandgap in graphene by using bilayer graphene and graphene nanoribbons. The basic operation of a conventional field effect transistor is explained and key figures of merit used in the literature are extracted. Finally, a review of some examples of state-of-the-art graphene field effect transistors is presented, with particular focus on monolayer graphene, bilayer graphene, and graphene nanoribbons.</summary>
