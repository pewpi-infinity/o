    <summary>Metallic hydrogen is capable of showing room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental syntheses are extremely hard. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the synthesis pressure of metallic hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization of hydrogen by "chemical precompression" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still requires relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve high-temperature superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting ammonium ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the periodic table reveal 12 elements which can form kinetically stable and superconducting hydrides at low pressures, where the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up to 118.40, 105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to atomic H, facilitating metallization of hydrogen under mild pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships, one is the H-atom charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first ionization energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature. Besides, ZnN2H8, CdN2H8, and HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure, and the presence of interstitial electrons suggests that they are also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78, and 3.05 eV) imply that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.</summary>

    <title>Irrelevance of 1H composition to the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates: judging from the MeV energy scale</title>

    <summary>The discovery of the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates, as topotactically reduced from their respective perovskite percussors via co-annealing with CaH2, extends the understanding in superconductivity. Nevertheless, whether the incorporated 1H composition is critical to the infinite-layer superconductivity recently arouses considerable debates, while the central challenge lies in the quantification of 1H that is easily interfered by the conventional electron or orbital associated processes. Herein, we demonstrate the irrelevance between the superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelates and their incorporated 1H composition, assisted by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and heavy ion energy recoil detection analysis (HIERDA) based on the nuclear interactions at MeV energy scale. These approaches completely overwhelm the conventional interferes, such as ionization, activation and chemical bonds, and achieves the 1H quantification within superconducting La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 (or Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2). A large diversity of 1H composition far beyond the previously expected critical dome was observed, while their TC were not changed significantly. Furthermore, the superconductivity was demonstrated to be achievable for La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 reduced by Al without any hydrogen associated process, while the superconducting properties for the CaH2 reduced La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 is rather stable after long term exposure in air, despite the high volatility of 1H within oxides. All these results indicate that the 1H incorporation composition is not critical to the superconductivity of the infinite-layer nickelates.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity of metallic boron in MgB_2</title>

    <summary>  Boron in MgB_2 forms layers of honeycomb lattices with magnesium as a space filler. Band structure calculations indicate that Mg is substantially ionized, and the bands at the Fermi level derive mainly from B orbitals. Strong bonding with an ionic component and considerable metallic density of states yield a sizeable electron-phonon coupling. Using the rigid atomic sphere approximation and an analogy to Al, we estimate the coupling constant lambda to be of order 1. Together with high phonon frequencies, which we estimate via zone-center frozen phonon calculations to be between 300 and 700 cm^-1, this produces a high critical temperature, consistent with recent experiments reporting Tc=39 K (J. Akimitsu et al., to be published). Thus MgB_2 can be viewed as an analog of the long sought, but still hypothetical, superconducting metallic hydrogen.</summary>
