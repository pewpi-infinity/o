    <summary>Anyon usually exists as collective excitation of two dimensional electron gas subjected to strong magnetic field, carrying fractional charges and exotic statistical character beyond fermion and boson. Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is the only experimental system showing solid evidence of anyon and a serial of fractional charges so far. Searching for new serial of fractional charges in FQHE or other physical system is still a challenge for both theoretical and experimental study. Here a topological fusion theory of propagating paths winding around a pair of fluxes is proposed to explore the physical origin of fractional charges. This topological path fusion theory not only generated all of the existed serial of fractional charges in FQHE and found the exact correspondence between FQHE and integral quantum Hall effect (IQHE), but also predicted new serial of fractional charges in FQHE. Further more, serial irrational charges like $2/(3+\sqrt{2})$ in one dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes as well as that in two dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes, such as $(1+\sqrt{2})$, are predicted. Even in three dimensional network of magnetic fluxes, a serial of fractionally charged anyon is predicted by this topological path fusion theory, which has exactly correspondence with the knot lattice model of anyon. In fact, in a multi-connected space time without magnetic field, this topological path fusion theory still holds, revealing an universal existence of fractional charge and mass in quantum material with strong confinement of particles (such as photonic crystal with porous nano-structures) and paving a new way for topological quantum computation.</summary>

    <summary>  We diagonalize the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous vertex models of the 6-vertex type in the anti-ferroelectric regime intoducing new types of q-vertex operators. The special cases of those models were used to diagonalize the s-d exchange model\cite{W,A,FW1}. New vertex operators are constructed from the level one vertex operators by the fusion procedure and have the description by bosons. In order to clarify the particle structure we estabish new isomorphisms of crystals. The results are very simple and figure out representation theoretically the ground state degenerations.</summary>

    <title>A theory of 2+1D bosonic topological orders</title>

    <summary>In primary school, we were told that there are four phases of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than four phases of matter, such as hundreds of crystal phases, liquid crystal phases, ferromagnet, anti-ferromagnet, superfluid, etc. Those phases of matter are so rich, it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. However, there are even more interesting phases of matter that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. In this paper, we review new "topological" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new zero-temperature phases -- topologically ordered phases. Microscopically, topologically orders are originated from the patterns of long-range entanglement in the ground states. As a truly new type of order and a truly new kind of phenomena, topological order and long-range entanglement require a new language and a new mathematical framework, such as unitary fusion category and modular tensor category to describe them. In this paper, we will describe a simple mathematical framework based on measurable quantities of topological orders $(S,T,c)$ proposed around 1989. The framework allows us to systematically describe/classify 2+1D topological orders (ie topological orders in local bosonic/spin/qubit systems)..</summary>
