    <summary>Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$, establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.</summary>

    <title>Theoretical study of the insulating oxides and nitrides: SiO2, GeO2, Al2O3, Si3N4, and Ge3N4</title>

    <summary>  An extensive theoretical study is performed for wide bandgap crystalline oxides and nitrides, namely, SiO_{2}, GeO_{2}, Al_{2}O_{3}, Si_{3}N_{4}, and Ge_{3}N_{4}. Their important polymorphs are considered which are for SiO_{2}: $α$-quartz, $α$- and $β$-cristobalite and stishovite, for GeO_{2}: $α$-quartz, and rutile, for Al_{2}O_{3}: $α$-phase, for Si_{3}N_{4} and Ge_{3}N_{4}: $α$- and $β$-phases. This work constitutes a comprehensive account of both electronic structure and the elastic properties of these important insulating oxides and nitrides obtained with high accuracy based on density functional theory within the local density approximation. Two different norm-conserving \textit{ab initio} pseudopotentials have been tested which agree in all respects with the only exception arising for the elastic properties of rutile GeO_{2}. The agreement with experimental values, when available, are seen to be highly satisfactory. The uniformity and the well convergence of this approach enables an unbiased assessment of important physical parameters within each material and among different insulating oxide and nitrides. The computed static electric susceptibilities are observed to display a strong correlation with their mass densities. There is a marked discrepancy between the considered oxides and nitrides with the latter having sudden increase of density of states away from the respective band edges. This is expected to give rise to excessive carrier scattering which can practically preclude bulk impact ionization process in Si_{3}N_{4} and Ge_{3}N_{4}.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen incorporation into amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide thin-film transistors</title>
    <updated>2021-11-16T16:09:48Z</updated>

    <summary>Within the subgap of amorphous oxide semiconductors like amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) are donor-like and acceptor-like states that control the operational physics of optically transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs). Hydrogen incorporation into the channel layer of a top-gate a-IGZO TFT exists as an electron donor that causes an observed negative shift in the drain current-gate voltage ($\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$) transfer curve turn-on voltage. Normally, hydrogen is thought to create shallow electronic states just below the conduction band mobility edge, with the donor ionization state controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics involving the position of the Fermi level with respect to the donor ionization energy. However, hydrogen does not behave as a normal donor as revealed by the subgap density of states (DoS) measured by the photoconduction response of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs to within 0.3 eV of the CBM edge. Specifically, the DoS shows a subgap peak above the valence band mobility edge growing at the same rate that $\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$ transfer curve measurements suggest that hydrogen was incorporated into the channel layer. Such hydrogen donor behavior in a-IGZO is anomalous and can be understood as follows: Non-bonded hydrogen ionization precedes its incorporation into the a-IGZO network as a bonded species. Ionized hydrogen bonds to a charged oxygen-on-an-oxygen-site anion, resulting in the formation of a defect complex denoted herein as, $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$. Formation of an $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$ defect complex creates a spectrally-broad ($\sim$0.3 eV FWHM) distribution of electronic states observed in the bandgap centered at 0.4 eV above the valence band mobility edge.</summary>
