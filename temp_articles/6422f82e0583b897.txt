    <title>The interpretation of quantum mechanics and of probability: Identical role of the 'observer'</title>

    <summary>The aim of the article is to argue that the interpretations of quantum mechanics and of probability are much closer than usually thought. Indeed, a detailed analysis of the concept of probability (within the standard frequency theory of R. von Mises) reveals that the latter concept always refers to an observing system. The enigmatic role of the observer in the Copenhagen interpretation therefore derives from a precise understanding of probability. Besides explaining several elements of the Copenhagen interpretation, our model also allows to reinterpret recent results from 'relational quantum mechanics', and to question the premises of the 'subjective approach to quantum probabilities'.</summary>

    <title>Probability amplitude in quantum like games</title>

    <summary>  Examples of games between two partners with mixed strategies, calculated by the use of the probability amplitude are given. The first game is described by the quantum formalism of spin one half system for which two noncommuting observables are measured.
  The second game corresponds to the spin one case.
 Quantum logical orthocomplemented nondistributive lattices for these two games are presented. Interference terms for the probability amplitudes are analyzed by using so called contextual approach to probability (in the von Mises frequency approach). We underline that our games are not based on using of some microscopic systems. The whole scenario is macroscopic.</summary>

    <title>Photoemissive sources and quantum stochastic calculus</title>

    <summary>  Just at the beginning of quantum stochastic calculus Hudson and Parthasarathy proposed a quantum stochastic Schrodinger equation linked to dilations of quantum dynamical semigroups. Such an equation has found applications in physics, mainly in quantum optics, but not in its full generality. It has been used to give, at least approximately, the dynamics of photoemissive sources such as an atom absorbing and emitting light or matter in an optical cavity, which exchanges light with the surrounding free space. But in these cases the possibility of introducing the gauge (or number) process in the dynamical equation has not been considered. In this paper we show, in the case of the simplest photoemissive source, namely a two-level atom stimulated by a laser, how the full Hudson-Parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent way not only absorption and emission, but also the elastic scattering of the light by the atom. Morever, we study the differential and total cross sections for the scattering of laser light by the atom, as a function of the frequency of the stimulating laser. The resulting line-shape is very interesting. Not only a Lorentzian shape is permitted, but the full variety of Fano profiles can be obtained. The dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the stimulating laser is computed; in particular, the resonance position turns out to be intensity dependent, a phenomenon known as lamp shift.</summary>
