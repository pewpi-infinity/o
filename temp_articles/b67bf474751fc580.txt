    <summary>  A major issue in the development of the technology of nitride based materials is the choice of substrate. The structural and optical properties of the layers are intimately connected to the substrate material used in the epitaxial growth. Key issues include lattice matching of substrate and epitaxial layer and the difference in the thermal expansion between the substrate and epitaxial layer. Due to the extremely high vapor pressure of nitrogen over Gallium Nitride (GaN), pure GaN substrate are very difficult to produce and currently almost all nitride-based device are fabricated by hetero-epitaxy on either Sapphire or Silicon Carbide (SiC). Alternatively, AlN has a significantly lower vapor pressure of nitrogen and can be grown in bulk form. In this paper we report on our results in the growth of AlN by physical vapor transport. A theoretical model was developed to investigate the growth process by to determine optimal growth parameters. Several different seed crystals were investigated, singular 6H-SiC, 3.50 off-axis 6H-SiC and 80 off-axis 4H-SiC, and AlN grown by hydride vapor deposition on silicon substrates (the silicon substrates were subsequently removed by etching). Auger electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and various X-ray diffraction techniques were used to investigate the samples grown.</summary>

    <summary>The stacking and bending of graphene are trivial but extremely powerful agents of control over graphene's manifold physics. By changing the twist angle, one can drive the system over a plethora of exotic states via strong electron correlation, thanks to the moiré superlattice potentials, while the periodic or triaxial strains induce discretization of the band structure into Landau levels without the need for an external magnetic field. We fabricated a hybrid system comprising both the stacking and bending tuning knobs. We have grown the graphene monolayers by chemical vapor deposition, using $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C precursors, which enabled us to individually address the layers through Raman spectroscopy mapping. We achieved the long-range spatial modulation by sculpturing the top layer ($^{13}$C) over uniform magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on the bottom layer ($^{12}$C). An atomic force microscopy study revealed that the top layer tends to relax into pyramidal corrugations with C$_3$ axial symmetry at the position of the NPs, which have been widely reported as a source of large pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) in graphene monolayers. The modulated graphene bilayer (MGBL) also contains a few micrometer large domains, with the twist angle ~ 10$^{\circ}$, which were identified via extreme enhancement of the Raman intensity of the G-mode due to formation of Van Hove singularities (VHSs). We thereby conclude that the twist induced VHSs coexist with the PMFs generated in the strained pyramidal objects without mutual disturbance. The graphene bilayer modulated with magnetic NPs is a non-trivial hybrid system that accommodates features of twist induced VHSs and PMFs in environs of giant classical spins.</summary>

    <title>Single Layer Behavior and Its Breakdown in Twisted Graphene Layers</title>

    <summary>We report high magnetic field scanning tunneling microscopy and Landau level spectroscopy of twisted graphene layers grown by chemical vapor deposition. For twist angles exceeding ~3 degrees the low energy carriers exhibit Landau level spectra characteristic of massless Dirac fermions. Above 20 degrees the layers effectively decouple and the electronic properties are indistinguishable from those in single layer graphene, while for smaller angles we observe a slow-down of the carrier velocity which is strongly angle dependent. At the smallest angles the spectra are dominated by twist induced Van Hove singularities and the Dirac fermions eventually become localized. An unexpected electron-hole asymmetry is observed which is substantially larger than the asymmetry in either single or untwisted bilayer graphene.</summary>
