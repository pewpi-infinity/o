    <summary>In this PhD thesis, quantum devices based on molecular-beam epitaxy grown InAs semiconductor with an in-situ grown epitaxial Al film were investigated. Novel device geometries were realized that allow for the study of bound states that emerge at low temperatures in semiconducting nanowires due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman effect, and superconducting proximity effect. Experiments utilizing either gate-defined nanowires in two-dimensional heterostructures or vapor-liquid-solid grown nanowires with a full-shell of Al are presented. Devices and experimental methods were developed that allow for tunneling spectroscopy at multiple locations of a nanowire. Results of nonlocal conductance transport measurements of Andreev bound states are discussed. Due to their extended wavefunction, bound states that are locally hybridized with a quantum dot show characteristic signatures in tunneling spectroscopy at neighboring measurement locations. If the distance between neighboring tunneling measurement locations is larger than 0.8 $\mathrm{μm}$ no signatures of extended bound states was observed.</summary>

    <title>Does the Mott problem extend to Geiger counters?</title>

    <summary>The Mott problem is a simpler version of the quantum measurement problem that asks: Is there a microscopic physical mechanism - based (explicitly or implicitly) only on Schroedinger's equation - that explains why a single alpha particle emitted in a spherically symmetric s-wave nuclear decay produces a manifestly non-spherically-symmetric single track in a cloud chamber? I attempt here to generalize earlier work that formulated such a mechanism. The key ingredient there was identification of sites at which the cross section for ionization by a passing charged particle is near singular at ionization threshold. This near singularity arose from a Penning-like process involving molecular polarization in sub-critical vapor clusters. Here, I argue that the same Mott problem question should be asked about Geiger counters. I then define a simple experiment to determine if ionization physics similar to the cloud chamber case takes place in the mica window of a Geiger counter and explains the collimation of wavefunctions that are spherically symmetric outside the counter into linear tracks inside. The experiment measures the count rate from a radioactive point source as a function of source-window separation. I have performed a proof of concept of this experiment; results are reported here and support the near-singular-ionization picture. These results are significant in their own right, but also because they may shed light on physical mechanisms underlying the full quantum measurement problem. I illustrate this for the Stern-Gerlach experiment and a particular realization of superconducting qubits. I conclude by detailing further work required to flesh out these results more rigorously.</summary>
