    <summary>  Just at the beginning of quantum stochastic calculus Hudson and Parthasarathy proposed a quantum stochastic Schrodinger equation linked to dilations of quantum dynamical semigroups. Such an equation has found applications in physics, mainly in quantum optics, but not in its full generality. It has been used to give, at least approximately, the dynamics of photoemissive sources such as an atom absorbing and emitting light or matter in an optical cavity, which exchanges light with the surrounding free space. But in these cases the possibility of introducing the gauge (or number) process in the dynamical equation has not been considered. In this paper we show, in the case of the simplest photoemissive source, namely a two-level atom stimulated by a laser, how the full Hudson-Parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent way not only absorption and emission, but also the elastic scattering of the light by the atom. Morever, we study the differential and total cross sections for the scattering of laser light by the atom, as a function of the frequency of the stimulating laser. The resulting line-shape is very interesting. Not only a Lorentzian shape is permitted, but the full variety of Fano profiles can be obtained. The dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the stimulating laser is computed; in particular, the resonance position turns out to be intensity dependent, a phenomenon known as lamp shift.</summary>

    <title>Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems</title>

    <summary>Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</summary>

    <title>Quantum walks on a circle with optomechanical systems</title>

    <summary>We propose an implementation of a quantum walk on a circle on an optomechanical system by encoding the walker on the phase space of a radiation field and the coin on a two-level state of a mechanical resonator. The dynamics of the system is obtained by applying Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. We numerically show that the system displays typical behaviors of quantum walks, namely, the probability distribution evolves ballistically and the standard deviation of the phase distribution is linearly proportional to the number of steps. We also analyze the effects of decoherence by using the phase damping channel on the coin space, showing the possibility to implement the quantum walk with present day technology.</summary>
