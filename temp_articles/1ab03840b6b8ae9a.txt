    <summary>  We recall that hydrogen combustion does resolve the environmental problems of fossil fuels due to excessive emission of carcinogenic substances and carbon dioxide. However, hydrogen combustion implies the permanent removal from our atmosphere of directly usable oxygen, a serious environmental problem called oxygen depletion, since the combustion turns oxygen into water whose separation to restore the original oxygen is prohibitive due to cost. We then show that a conceivable global use of hydrogen in complete replacement of fossil fuels would imply the permanent removal from our atmosphere of 2.8875x10^7 metric tons O_2/day. Fuel cells are briefly discussed to point out similarly serious environmental problems, again, for large uses. We propose the possibility of resolving these problems by upgrading hydrogen to the new combustible fuel called magnegas^TM, whose chemical structure is composed by the new chemical species of magnecules, whose energy content and other features are beyond the descriptive capacities of quantum chemistry. In fact, magnegas contains up to 50% hydrogen, while having combustion exhaust with: 1) a positive oxygen balance (releasing more oxygen in the exhaust than that used in the combustion); 2) no appreciable carcinogenic or toxic substances; 3) considerably reduced carbon dioxide as compared to fossil fuels; 4) considerably reduced nitrogen oxides; and 5) general reduction of pollutants in the exhaust up to 96% of current EPA standards.</summary>

    <title>Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $α$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication</title>

    <summary>$α$-Tantalum ($α$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $α$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $α$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</summary>

    <title>The Quantum Nature in the Interaction of Molecular Hydrogen with Porous Materials: Implications for Practical Hydrogen Storage</title>

    <summary>The storage of hydrogen (H$_2$) is of economic and ecological relevance, because it could potentially replace petroleum-based fuels. However, H$_2$ storage at mild condition remains one of the bottlenecks for its widespread usage. In order to devise successful H$_2$ storage strategies, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of the weak and elusive hydrogen interactions at the quantum mechanical level. One of the most promising strategies for storage at mild pressure and temperature is physisorption. Porous materials are specially effective at physisorption, however the process at the quantum level has been under-studied. Here, we present quantum calculations to study the interaction of H$_2$ with building units of porous materials. We report 240 H$_2$ complexes made of different transition metal (Tm) atoms, chelating ligands, spins, oxidation states, and geometrical configurations. We found that both the dispersion and electrostatics interactions are the major contributors to the interaction energy between H$_2$ and the transition metal complexes. The binding energy for some of these complexes is in the range of at least 10 kJ/mol for many interactions sites, which is one of these main requirements for practical H$_2$ storage. Thus, these results are of fundamental nature for practical H$_2$ storage in porous materials.</summary>
