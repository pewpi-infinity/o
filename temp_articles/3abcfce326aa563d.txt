    <summary>  We investigate the effects of bosonic trilinear interactions in preheating after chaotic inflation. A trilinear interaction term allows for the complete decay of the massive inflaton particles, which is necessary for the transition to radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is subdominant during early stages of preheating, but it actually amplifies parametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the trilinear term does dominate during preheating, the process occurs through periodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective that preheating completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an analytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also study numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics after preheating. The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate after preheating, leading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it. Finally, we investigate the role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during preheating. We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while still in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. Preheating due to these terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance.</summary>

    <title>Tachyonic Resonance Preheating in Expanding Universe</title>

    <summary>  In this paper the tachyonic resonance preheating generated from the bosonic trilinear $φχ^2$ interactions in an expanding Universe is studied. In $λφ^4/4$ inflationary model the trilinear interaction, in contrast to the four-legs $φ^2χ^2$, breaks the conformal symmetry explicitly and the resonant source term becomes non-periodic, making the Floquet theorem inapplicable. We find that the occupation number of the produced $χ$-particles has a non-linear exponential growth with exponent $\sim x^{3/2}$, where $x$ is the conformal time. This should be contrasted with preheating from a periodic resonant source, arising for example from the four-legs $φ^2χ^2$ interaction, where the occupation number has a linear exponential growth. We present an analytic method to compute the interference term coming from phases accumulated in non-tachyonic scattering regions and show that the effects of the interference term causes ripples on $x^{3/2}$ curve, a result which is confirmed by numerical analysis. Studying the effects of back-reaction of the $χ$-particles, we show that tachyonic resonance preheating in our model can last long enough to transfer most of the energy from the background inflation field $φ$, providing an efficient model for preheating in the chaotic inflation models.</summary>

    <title>Direct Channel Dominance in Goldstone Boson Scattering in the Resonance Region</title>

    <summary>  We consider the scattering of Goldstone bosons in the range of intermediate energies, and in particular focus our attention on the scattering of pions in the $ρ$-resonance region. The chiral perturbation series is obtained to order $E^4$ from a chiral $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ invariant effective Lagrangian. At order $E^4$, we isolate the low-energy manifestation of heavy particle exchange in the s-channel. We find that the contributions of this type to the I=1 and I=2 amplitudes have a one parameter dependence. This observation provides a symmetry rationale for Chanowitz's recent observation that in a chiral model with an explicitly coupled $ρ$, the I=1 and I=2 channels are strongly correlated. In order to realize, in a quantitative way, the fact that in the resonance region the direct-channel dominates, we make use of a simple and intuitive unitarization scheme. This allows us to derive a renormalization constant-independent relation for the I=1 and I=2 phase shifts. With the assumption of a $ρ$-resonance, this relation determines the position of a pole at euclidean momentum in the I=2 channel. Through an analysis based on the theory of redundant poles and the Adler sum rule we show that this ``tachyon'' pole actually represents a physical contribution to the unitary amplitude which accounts for $ρ$ and $ε$ exchange in the u-channel.</summary>
