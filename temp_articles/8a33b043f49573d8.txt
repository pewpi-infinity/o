    <summary>The electronic properties of lanthanide (from Eu to Tm) impurities in wurtzite gallium nitride and zinc oxide were investigated by first principles calculations, using an all electron methodology plus a Hubbard potential correction. The results indicated that the 4f-related energy levels remain outside the bandgap in both materials, in good agreement with a recent phenomenological model, based on experimental data. Additionally, zinc oxide doped with lanthanide impurities became an n-type material, showing a coupling between the 4f-related spin polarized states and the carriers. This coupling may generate spin polarized currents, which could lead to applications in spintronic devices.</summary>

    <summary>Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) sols have been synthesized from SnCl2.2H2O precursor solution by applying two different processing conditions. The prepared sols were then deposited on UV-Ozone treated quartz and soda lime glass (SLG) substrates by spin coating. The as-synthesized film was soft-baked at about 100 deg. C. for 10 min. This process was repeated five times to get a compact film, followed by air-annealing at 250 deg. C. for 2 hours. The pristine and annealed films were characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, Grazing Incident X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The effect of the substrate surface was investigated by measuring the contact angles with De-Ionized (DI) water. UV-Ozone treatment of substrate provides a cleaner surface to grow a homogeneous film. The electrical resistivity of annealed thin films was carried out by a four-point-collinear probe employing the current reversal technique and found in the range of approx. 2x10^3 to 3x10^3 Ohm-cm. Film thickness was found in the range of approx. 137-285 nm, measured by a stylus profilometer. UV-VIs-NIR Transmission data revealed that all the thin film samples showed maximum (82-89) % transmission in the visible range. The optical bandgap of the thin films was estimated to be approx. 3.75-4.00 eV and approx. 3.78-4.35 eV for the films grown on SLG and quartz substrates, respectively.</summary>

    <title>Simulation study of ballistic spin-MOSFET devices with ferromagnetic channels based on some Heusler and oxide compounds</title>

    <summary>Newly emerged materials from the family of Heuslers and complex oxides exhibit finite bandgaps and ferromagnetic behavior with Curie temperatures much higher than even room temperature. In this work, using the semiclassical top-of-the-barrier FET model, we explore the operation of a spin-MOSFET that utilizes such ferromagnetic semiconductors as channel materials, in addition to ferromagnetic source/drain contacts. Such a device could retain the spin polarization of injected electrons in the channel, the loss of which limits the operation of traditional spin transistors with non-ferromagnetic channels. We examine the operation of four material systems that are currently considered some of the most prominent known ferromagnetic semiconductors, three Heusler-type alloys (Mn2CoAl, CrVZrAl, CoVZrAl) and one from the oxide family (NiFe2O4). We describe their bandstructures by using data from DFT calculations. We investigate under which conditions high spin polarization and significant ION/IOFF ratio, two essential requirements for the spin-MOSFET operation, are both achieved. We show that these particular Heusler channels, in their bulk form, do not have adequate bandgap to provide high ION/IOFF ratios, and have small magnetoconductance compared to state-of-the-art devices. However, with confinement into ultra-narrow sizes down to a few nanometers, and by engineering their spin dependent contact resistances, they could prove promising channel materials for the realization of spin-MOSFET transistor devices that offer combined logic and memory functionalities. Although the main compounds of interest in this paper are Mn2CoAl, CrVZrAl, CoVZrAl, and NiFe2O4 alone, we expect that the insight we provide is relevant to other classes of such materials as well.</summary>
