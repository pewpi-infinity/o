    <summary>We derive an analytic behavior of the Casimir free energy, entropy and pressure of metallic films in vacuum at low temperature. It is shown that this behavior differs significantly depending on whether the plasma or the Drude model is used to describe the dielectric properties of film metal. For metallic films described by the lossless plasma model the thermal corrections to the Casimir energy and pressure drop to zero exponentially fast with increasing film thickness. There is no classical limit in this case. The Casimir entropy satisfies the Nernst heat theorem. For metallic films with perfect crystal lattices described by the Drude model the Casimir entropy at zero temperature takes a nonzero value depending on the parameters of a film, i.e., the Nernst heat theorem is violated. The Casimir entropy at zero temperature is positive, as opposed to the case of two metallic plates separated with a vacuum gap, where it is negative if the Drude model is used. Possible applications of the obtained results in investigations of stability of thin films are discussed.</summary>

    <summary>Quantum geometry is a key quantity that distinguishes electrons in a crystal from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However, unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moiré systems with flat bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field equations remains sourceless for pure states while for mixed states it acquires a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy, for small entropies. We compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general relativity and conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force. Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space gravity and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual gravity in quantum materials.</summary>

    <title>Role of intermediate 4$f$ states in tuning the band structure of high entropy oxides</title>

    <summary>High entropy oxides (HEOs) are single phase solid solutions consisting of 5 or more cations in approximately equiatomic proportions. In this study, we show reversible control of optical properties in a rare-earth (RE) based HEO-(Ce$_{0.2}$La$_{0.2}$Pr$_{0.2}$Sm$_{0.2}$Y$_{0.2}$)O$_{2-δ}$ and subsequently utilize a combination of spectroscopic techniques to derive the features of the electronic band structure underpinning the observed optical phenomena. Heat treatment of the HEO under vacuum atmosphere followed by reheat-treatment in air results in a reversible change of the band gap energy, from 1.9 eV to 2.5 eV. The finding is consistent with the reversible changes in the oxidation state and related $f$-orbital occupancy of Pr. However, no pertinent changes in the phase composition or crystal structure is observed upon the vacuum heat treatment. Further annealing of this HEO under H$_2$ atmosphere, followed by reheat-treatment in air, results in even larger but still reversible change of the band gap energy from 1.9 eV to 3.2 eV. This is accompanied by a disorder-order type crystal structure transition and changes in the O 2$p$-RE 5$d$ hybridization evidenced from X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES). The O $K$ and RE ${M_{4,5}}$/$L_{3}$ XANES indicate that the presence of Ce and Pr (in 3+/4+) state leads to the formation of intermediate 4$f$ energy levels between the O 2$p$ and RE 5$d$ gap in HEO. It is concluded that heat treatment under reducing/oxidizing atmospheres affects these intermediate levels, thus, offering the possibility to tune the band gap energy in HEO.</summary>
