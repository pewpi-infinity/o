    <summary>Negative hydrogen ion sources are used as injectors into accelerators and drive the neutral beam heating in ITER. Certain processes in low-temperature hydrogen plasmas are accompanied by the emission of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emission. Studying the VUV radiation therefore provides volumetric rates of plasma-chemical processes and plasma parameters. In the past we have used gasdynamic ECR discharge for volumetric negative ion production and investigated the dependencies between the extracted H$^-$ current density and various ion source parameters. It was shown that it is possible to reach up to 80 mA/cm$^2$ of negative ion current density with a two electrode extraction. We report experimental studies on negative hydrogen ion production in a high-density gasdynamic ECR discharge plasma consisting of two simple mirror traps together with the results of VUV emission measurements. The VUV-power was measured in three ranges -- Ly$_α$, Lyman band and molecular continuum -- varying the source control parameters near their optima for H$^-$ production. It was shown that the molecular continuum emission VUV power is the highest in the first chamber while Ly$_α$ emission prevails in the second one. Modifications for the experimental scheme for further optimization of negative hydrogen ion production are suggested.</summary>

    <summary>We report experimental results of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emission from the plasma of an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharge in hydrogen, sustained by powerful millimeter-wavelength radiation of a gyrotron. Distinctive features of the considered discharge are the high plasma density ($10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ order of magnitude) and, at the same time, the high electron average energy ($10 - 300$ eV), which makes it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of VUV re-emission of the energy deposited into the plasma by the microwave radiation. Experiments were performed with the plasma confined in a simple mirror trap and heated by pulsed gyrotron radiation $37.5$ GHz / $100$ kW under the ECR condition. The measured volumetric VUV emission power of Lyman-alpha line ($122 \pm 10$ nm) overlapping with the Werner band, Lyman band ($160 \pm 10$ nm), and molecular continuum ($180 \pm 20$ nm) reached $45$, $25$, and $55$ W/cm$^3$, respectively. The total absolute radiation power in these three ranges integrated over the plasma volume is estimated to be $22$ kW i.e. $22$% of the incident microwave power, which matches theoretical predictions. Further optimization of the conditions of the ECR hydrogen discharge sustained by powerful gyrotron radiation provides an opportunity for the development of effective technological VUV sources of a kilowatt power level.</summary>

    <title>On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma</title>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>
