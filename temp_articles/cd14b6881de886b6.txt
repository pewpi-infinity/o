    <summary>Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) provides a low-temperature, highly-efficient, and catalyst-free route to fabricate graphene materials by virtue of the unique properties of plasma. In this paper, we conduct reactive molecular dynamics simulations to theoretically study the detailed growth process of graphene by PECVD at the atomic scale. Hydrocarbon radicals with different carbon/hydrogen (C/H) ratios are employed as dissociated precursors in the plasma environment during the growth process. The simulation results show that hydrogen content in the precursors significantly affects the growth behavior and critical properties of graphene. The highest number of hexagonal carbon rings formed in the graphene sheets, which is an indicator of their quality, is achieved for a C/H ratio of 1:1 in the precursors. Moreover, increasing the content of hydrogen in the precursors is shown to reduce the growth rate of carbon clusters, and prevent the formation of curved carbon structures during the growth process. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the fundamental mechanisms regarding the effects of hydrogen on the growth of graphene in a PECVD process.</summary>

    <title>Methane as an effective hydrogen source for single-layer graphene synthesis on Cu foil by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition</title>

    <summary>A single-layer graphene is synthesized on Cu foil in the absence of H2 flow by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In lieu of an explicit H2 flow, hydrogen species are produced during methane decomposition process into their active species (CHx&lt;4), assisted by the plasma. Notably, the early stage of growth depends strongly on the plasma power. The resulting grain size (the nucleation density) has a maximum (minimum) at 50 W and saturates when the plasma power is higher than 120 W because hydrogen partial pressures are effectively tuned by a simple control of the plasma power. Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements show that decomposed methane alone can provide sufficient amount of hydrogen species for high-quality graphene synthesis by PECVD.</summary>

    <title>Large area graphene synthesis on catalytic copper foil by an indigenous electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup</title>

    <summary>A novel route for the synthesis of large area graphene by an indigenously built electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) setup has been reported in this work. A unique 2.45 GHz permanent magnet type ECR PECVD system has been designed and developed for the growth of various nano-structures and films. The apparatus has a unique advantage to synthesize large area graphene at much lower additional substrate heating than heat supplied by an external oven in conventional thermal CVD method. A major amount of heat is supplied here by ECR plasma. Polycrystalline copper foil is used here as a catalytic substrate which is pre annealed inside resonant hydrogen plasma prior to its exposure under precursor gaseous plasma inside the ECR PECVD reactor. Methane is used as carbon precursor along with hydrogen as carrier gas. Argon gas is used for the rapid cooling of the substrate maintaining suitable thermodynamic condition favorable for graphene synthesis. The synthesis process has been carried out by controlling growth temperature, total pressure and synthesis time at various gas ratios. The exposed copper foil has been characterized by Raman spectroscopy to investigate the quality of synthesized graphene in the home made reactor.</summary>
