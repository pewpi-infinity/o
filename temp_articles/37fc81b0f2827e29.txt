    <summary>The phase space of visible particles in missing energy events may have singularity structures. The singularity variables are devised to capture the singularities effectively for given event topology. They can greatly improve the discovery potential of new physics signals as well as to extract the mass spectrum information at hadron colliders. Focusing on the antler decay topology of resonance, we derive a novel singularity variable whose distribution has endpoints directly correlated with the resonance mass. As a practical application, we examine the applicability of the singularity variable to the searches for heavy neutral Higgs bosons in the two-Higgs doublet model.</summary>

    <summary>  There continues to be enormous interest in the BCS to BEC transition as there still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance) superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW) isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair) has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a Feshbach resonance form of SC.</summary>

    <title>Relation between the Resonance and the Scattering Matrix in the massless Spin-Boson Model</title>

    <summary>We establish the precise relation between the integral kernel of the scattering matrix and the resonance in the massless Spin-Boson model which describes the interaction of a two-level quantum system with a second-quantized scalar field. For this purpose, we derive an explicit formula for the two-body scattering matrix. We impose an ultraviolet cut-off and assume a slightly less singular behavior of the boson form factor of the relativistic scalar field but no infrared cut-off. The purpose of this work is to bring together scattering and resonance theory and arrive at a similar result as provided by Simon in [38], where it was shown that the singularities of the meromorphic continuation of the integral kernel of the scattering matrix are located precisely at the resonance energies. The corresponding problem has been open in quantum field theory ever since. To the best of our knowledge, the presented formula provides the first rigorous connection between resonance and scattering theory in the sense of [38] in a model of quantum field theory.</summary>
