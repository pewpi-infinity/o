    <summary>We have measured the water and hydrogen outgassing rates of seven vacuum chambers of identical geometry but constructed of different materials and heat treatments. Chambers of five different materials were tested: 304L, 316L, and 316LN stainless steels; titanium (ASTM grade 2); and 6061 aluminum. In addition, chambers constructed of 316L and 316LN stainless steel were subjected to a vacuum-fire process, where they were heated to approximately 950 °C for 24 hours while under vacuum; these two chambers are designated as 316L-XHV and 316LN-XHV. All chambers were of identical geometry and made by the same manufacturer, thus a relative comparison of the outgassing rates among these chambers can be made. Water outgassing rates were measured as a function of time using the throughput technique. The water outgassing results for the 316L, 316LN, 316L-XHV, 316LN-XHV were all similar, but lower than those of 304L by a factor of 3 to 5 lower at 10^4 s. The water outgassing results for Ti and Al chambers were close to that of 304L, Ti being slightly lower. Hydrogen outgassing rates were measured using the rate-of-rise method and performed after a low-temperature bake of 125 °C to 150 °C for a minimum of 72 hours. The Ti, Al, 316L-XHV, and 316LN-XHV chambers all have specific outgassing rates below 1 X 10^-11 Pa L s^-1 cm^-2 and are at least a factor of 100 or better than the 304L chamber. The 304L, 316L, and 316LN chambers without vacuum-fire heat treatment have larger hydrogen outgassing rates than the other chambers, with specific outgassing rates ranging between 4.0 X 10^-11 Pa L s^-1 cm^-2 and 8.0 X 10^-11 Pa L s^-1 cm^-2. We conclude that Ti, Al, 316L-XHV, and 316LN-XHV have hydrogen outgassing rates that make them excellent choices for ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and extreme-high vacuum (XHV) applications, the choice depending on cost and other material properties.</summary>

    <summary>  We consider a multilevel hydrogen atom in interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field and separately calculate the contributions of the vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy of the atom for uniform acceleration. It is found that the acceleration disturbs the vacuum fluctuations in such a way that the delicate balance between the contributions of vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction that exists for inertial atoms is broken, so that the transitions to higher-lying states from ground state are possible even in vacuum. In contrast to the case of an atom interacting with a scalar field, the contributions of both electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the spontaneous emission rate are affected by the acceleration, and furthermore the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations contains a non-thermal acceleration-dependent correction, which is possibly observable.</summary>

    <title>The Role of Vacuum Fluctuations and Symmetry in the Hydrogen Atom in Quantum Mechanics and Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED)</title>

    <summary>Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED) has had success modeling black body radiation, the harmonic oscillator, the Casimir effect, van der Waals forces, diamagnetism, and uniform acceleration of electrodynamic systems using the stochastic zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field with classical mechanics. However the hydrogen atom, with its 1/r potential remains a critical challenge. Cole and Zou in 2003 and Nieuwenhuizen and Liska in 2015 found that the SED field prevented the electron orbit from collapsing into the proton but eventually the atom became ionized. We look at the issues of the H atom and SED from the perspective of symmetry of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian which is used to obtain the quantum mechanical results, and the Abraham-Lorentz equation, which is a force equation that includes the effects of radiation reaction and is used to obtain the SED simulations. We contrast the physical computed effects of the quantized electromagnetic vacuum flucuations with the role of the real stochastic electromagnetic field.</summary>
