    <summary>Quantum geometry is a key quantity that distinguishes electrons in a crystal from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However, unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moiré systems with flat bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field equations remains sourceless for pure states while for mixed states it acquires a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy, for small entropies. We compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general relativity and conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force. Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space gravity and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual gravity in quantum materials.</summary>

    <summary>Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</summary>

    <summary>We review the behavior of the entropy per particle in various two-dimensional electronic systems. The entropy per particle is an important characteristic of any many body system that tells how the entropy of the ensemble of electrons changes if one adds one more electron. Recently, it has been demonstrated how the entropy per particle of a two-dimensional electron gas can be extracted from the recharging current dynamics in a planar capacitor geometry. These experiments pave the way to the systematic studies of entropy in various crystal systems including novel two-dimensional crystals such as gapped graphene, germanene and silicene. Theoretically, the entropy per particle is linked to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential of the electron gas by the Maxwell relation. Using this relation, we calculate the entropy per particle in the vicinity of topological transitions in various two-dimensional electronic systems. We show that the entropy experiences quantized steps at the points of Lifshitz transitions in a two-dimensional electronic gas with a parabolic energy spectrum. In contrast, in doubled-gapped Dirac materials, the entropy per particles demonstrates characteristic spikes once the chemical potential passes through the band edges. The transition from a topological to trivial insulator phase in germanene is manifested by the disappearance of a strong zero-energy resonance in the entropy per particle dependence on the chemical potential. We conclude that studies of the entropy per particle shed light on multiple otherwise hidden peculiarities of the electronic band structure of novel two-dimensional crystals.</summary>
