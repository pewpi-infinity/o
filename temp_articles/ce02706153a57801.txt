    <summary>In a recent study it was suggested that the positively charged muon is capable of forming its own "atoms in molecule"s (AIM) in the muonic hydrogen-like molecules, composed of two electrons, a muon and one of the hydrogen isotopes, thus deserved to be placed in the Periodic Table [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16, 6602, 2014]. In present report, the capacity of the positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners within context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their congener hydrides and no new bonding models is required to describe the bonding of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively charged muon is similar to proton from structural and bonding viewpoint and deserved to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of the muonic molecules portraying the positively charged muon as a lighter isotope of hydrogen.</summary>

    <title>Deciphering the "chemical" nature of the exotic isotopes of Hydrogen by the MC-QTAIM analysis: The positively charged Muon and the Muonic Helium as new members of the Periodic Table</title>

    <summary>This report is a primarily survey on the chemical nature of some exotic species containing the positively charged muon and the muonic Helium, i.e., the negatively charged muon plus helium nucleus, as exotic isotopes of hydrogen, using the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (MC-QTAIM) analysis, employing ab initio non-Born-Oppenhiemer wavefunctions. Accordingly, the "atoms in molecules" analysis performed on various asymmetric exotic isotopomers of hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally [Science 331, 448 (2011)], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are capable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen atom. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing muonic helium cast no doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of hydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon are more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of appreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization; however, with some tolerance, they may be categorized also as hydrogen basins though with a smaller electronegativity. All in all, present study also clearly demonstrates that the MC-QTAIM analysis is an efficient approach to decipher the chemical nature of species containing exotic constituents, hard to be elucidated by experimental and/or alternative theoretical schemes.</summary>

    <title>Non-Diffracting Electron Vortex Beams Balancing Their Electron-Electron Interactions</title>

    <summary>By introducing concepts of beam shaping into quantum mechanics, we show how interference effects of the quantum wavefunction describing multiple electrons can exactly balance the repulsion among the electrons. With proper shaping of the fermionic wavefunction, we propose non-diffracting quantum wavepackets of multiple electrons that can also carry orbital angular momentum, in the form of multi-electron non-diffracting vortex beams. The wavefunction is designed to compensate for both the repulsion between electrons and for the diffraction-broadening. This wavefunction shaping facilitates the use of electron beams of higher current in numerous applications, thereby improving the signal-to-noise-ratio in electron microscopy and related systems without compromising on the spatial resolution. Our scheme potentially applies for any beams of charged particles, such as protons, muons and ion beams.</summary>
