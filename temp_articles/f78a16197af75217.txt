    <summary>Studies of neutrino mixing and oscillations, solar neutrinos as background in dark matter searches involving electron detection, detection of sterile neutrino warm dark matter, and of possible electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, have generated interest in the low energy O(10 keV) scattering of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos by atomic electrons where the binding of the atomic electron cannot be ignored. Of particular interest is the ionization of atoms by neutrinos and antineutrinos. Most existing calculations are based on modifications of the free electron differential cross section, which destroy the relationship between the neutrino helicities and the orbital and spin angular momenta of the atomic electrons. The present calculations maintain the full collision dynamics by formulating the scattering in configuration space using the Bound Interaction Picture, rather than the usual formulation in the Interaction Picture in momentum space as appropriate to scattering by free electrons. Energy spectra of ionization electrons produced by scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies of 5, 10, 20, and 30 keV by hydrogen, helium and neon have been calculated using Dirac central field eigenfunctions and are presented as ratios to the spectra for scattering by free electrons. Binding effects increase strongly with atomic number, are largest for low neutrino energy and, for each neutrino energy, greatest at the high electron energy end of the spectrum. The most extreme effects of binding are for 5 keV scattering by Ne where the ratios are less than 0.1. The energy spectra are calculated for both a Coulombic final electron state and a free final electron state. The results indicate that the binding effects from the continuum state of the final electron are significant and can be comparable to those arising from the bound initial electron state.</summary>

    <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in searches using the Migdal effect</title>

    <summary>Ionization or excitation resulting from the noninstantaneous response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so-called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino-induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</summary>

    <summary>The theory of scattering of low energy neutrinos and antineutrinos by atomic electrons has recently been developed (I. B. Whittingham, Phys. Rev. D 105, 013008 (2022)) using the Bound Interaction Picture in configuration space to fully implement the relationship between the neutrino helicities and the orbital and spin angular momenta of the atomic electrons. The energy spectra of ionization electrons produced by scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies of 5, 10, 20, and 30 keV by hydrogen, helium and neon were calculated using Dirac screened Coulombic eigenfunctions. This paper reports further applications of this theory, to a new calculation of the energy spectra for neon, as the original calculation used some screening constants which underestimated the effects of screening in the inner subshells, and to scattering by argon. The results are presented as ratios to the corresponding quantities for scattering by $Z$ free electrons. The new spectra ratios for neon are larger than the original ratios by approx 0.03 to approx 0.14, with the greatest increases occurring for 10 keV neutrinos and antineutrinos. Integrated spectra ratios range from 0.16 to 0.59 for neon, and from 0.15 to 0.48 for argon, as the neutrino energy increases from 5 to 30 keV.</summary>
