    <summary>Palladium (Pd) catalysts have been extensively studied for the direct synthesis of H2O through the hydrogen oxidation reaction at ambient conditions. This heterogeneous catalytic reaction not only holds considerable practical significance but also serves as a classical model for investigating fundamental mechanisms, including adsorption and reactions between adsorbates. Nonetheless, the governing mechanisms and kinetics of its intermediate reaction stages under varying gas conditions remains elusive. This is attributed to the intricate interplay between adsorption, atomic diffusion, and concurrent phase transformation of catalyst. Herein, the Pd-catalyzed, water-forming hydrogen oxidation is studied, in situ, to investigate intermediate reaction stages via fluid cell transmission electron microscopy. The dynamic behaviors of water generation, associated with reversible palladium hydride formation, are captured in real time with a nanoscale spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that the hydrogen oxidation rate catalyzed by Pd is significantly affected by the sequence in which gases are introduced. Through direct evidence of electron diffraction and density functional theory calculation, we demonstrate that the hydrogen oxidation rate is limited by adsorption processes of gas precursors. These nanoscale insights help identify the optimal reaction conditions for Pd-catalyzed hydrogen oxidation, which has substantial implications for water production technologies. The developed understanding also advocates a broader exploration of analogous mechanisms in other metal-catalyzed reactions.</summary>

    <title>Prolonging Carrier Lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC Epilayer by Thermal Oxidation and Hydrogen Annealing</title>

    <summary>A minority carrier lifetime of 25.46 $μ$s in a P-type 4H-SiC epilayer has been attained through sequential thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing. Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.</summary>

    <title>Water Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution with Organic Photooxidants: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

    <summary>In this perspective, we discuss a novel water-splitting scenario, namely the direct oxidation of water molecules by organic photooxidants in hydrogen-bonded chromophore-water complexes. In comparison with the established scenario of semiconductor-based water splitting, the distance of electron transfer processes is thereby reduced from mesoscopic scales to the Ångstrøm scale and the time scale is reduced from milliseconds to femtoseconds, which suppresses competing loss processes. The concept is illustrated by computational studies for the heptazine-H2O complex. The excited-state landscape of this complex has been characterized with ab initio electronic-structure methods and the proton-coupled electron-transfer dynamics has been explored with nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. A unique feature of the heptazine chromophore is the existence of a low-lying and exceptionally long-lived 1ππ* state in which a substantial part of the photon energy can be stored for hundreds of nanoseconds and is available for the oxidation of water molecules. The calculations reveal that the absorption spectra and the photochemical functionalities of heptazine chromophores can be systematically tailored by chemical substitution. The options of harvesting hydrogen and the problems posed by the high reactivity of OH radicals are discussed.</summary>
