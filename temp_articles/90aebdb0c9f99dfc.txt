    <summary>  We study the parametric resonance of the neutrino oscillation through the matter whose density varies spatially. The Fourier analysis of the matter effect enables us to clarify the parametric resonance condition, which is summarized in a frequency matching between the neutrino oscillation and the spatial variation of the matter density. As a result, the n-th Fourier mode of a matter density profile modifies the energy spectrum of the nu_mu -&gt; nu_e appearance probability at around the n-th dip.</summary>

    <summary>  A generation of neutrino experiments have established that neutrinos mix and probably have mass. The mixing phenomenon points to processes beyond those of the Standard Model, possibly at the Grand Unification energy scale. A extensive sequence of of experiments will be required to measure precisely all the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix, culminating with the discovery and study of leptonic CP violation. As a first step, extensions of conventional pion/kaon decay beams, such as off-axis beams or low-energy super-beams, have been considered. These could yield first observations of $ν_μ\to ν_e$ transitions at the atmospheric frequency, which have not yet been observed, and a first measurement of $θ_{13}$. Experiments with much better flux control can be envisaged if the neutrinos are obtained from the decays of stored particles. One such possibility is the concept of beta beams provided by the decays of radioactive nuclei, that has been developed within the context of these studies. These would provide a pure (anti-)electron-neutrino beam of a few hundred MeV, and beautiful complementarity with a high-intensity, low-energy conventional beam, enabling experimental probes of T violation as well as CP violation. Ultimately, a definitive and complete set of measurements would offered by a Neutrino Factory based on a muon storage ring. This powerful machine offers the largest reach for CP violation, even for very small values of $θ_{13}$.</summary>

    <title>Flavor-Universal Form of Neutrino Oscillation Probabilities in Matter</title>
    <updated>2015-12-21T23:47:27Z</updated>

    <summary>We construct a new perturbative framework to describe neutrino oscillation in matter with the unique expansion parameter ε, which is defined as Δm^2_{21} / Δm^2_{ren} with the renormalized atmospheric Δm^2_{ren} \equiv Δm^2_{31} - s^2_{12} Δm^2_{21}. It allows us to derive the maximally compact expressions of the oscillation probabilities in matter to order εin the form akin to those in vacuum. This feature allows immediate physical interpretation of the formulas, and facilitates understanding of physics of neutrino oscillations in matter. Moreover, quite recently, we have shown that our three-flavor oscillation probabilities P(ν_α\rightarrow ν_β) in all channels can be expressed in the form of universal functions of L/E. The ν_e disappearance oscillation probability P(ν_e \rightarrow ν_e) has a special property that it can be written as the two-flavor form which depends on the single frequency. This talk is based on the collaborating work with Stephen Parke [1].</summary>
