    <summary>We discuss different physical effects related to the uniform acceleration of atoms in vacuum, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. We first investigate the van der Waals/Casimir-Polder dispersion and resonance interactions between two uniformly accelerated atoms in vacuum. We show that the atomic acceleration significantly affects the van der Waals force, yielding a different scaling of the interaction with the interatomic distance and an explicit time dependence of the interaction energy. We argue how these results could allow for an indirect detection of the Unruh effect through dispersion interactions between atoms. We then consider the resonance interaction between two accelerated atoms, prepared in a correlated Bell-type state, and interacting with the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state, separating vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction contributions, both in the free-space and in the presence of a perfectly reflecting plate. We show that nonthermal effects of acceleration manifest in the resonance interaction, yielding a change of the distance dependence of the resonance interaction energy. This suggests that the equivalence between temperature and acceleration does not apply to all radiative properties of accelerated atoms. To further explore this aspect, we evaluate the resonance interaction between two atoms in non inertial motion in the coaccelerated (Rindler) frame and show that in this case the assumption of an Unruh temperature for the field is not required for a complete equivalence of locally inertial and coaccelerated points of views.</summary>

    <title>Dispersion Interactions between Neutral Atoms and the Quantum Electrodynamical Vacuum</title>

    <summary>Dispersion interactions are long-range interactions between neutral ground-state atoms or molecules, or polarizable bodies in general, due to their common interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field. They arise from the exchange of virtual photons between the atoms, and, in the case of three or more atoms, are not additive. In this review, after having introduced the relevant coupling schemes and effective Hamiltonians, as well as properties of the vacuum fluctuations, we~outline the main properties of dispersion interactions, both in the nonretarded (van der Waals) and retarded (Casimir--Polder) regime. We then discuss their deep relation with the existence of the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and vacuum energy. We describe some transparent physical models of two- and three-body dispersion interactions, based on dressed vacuum field energy densities and spatial field correlations, which stress their deep connection with vacuum fluctuations and vacuum energy. These models give a clear insight of the physical origin of dispersion interactions, and also provide useful computational tools for their evaluation. We show that this aspect is particularly relevant in more complicated situations, for example when macroscopic boundaries are present. We also review recent results on dispersion interactions for atoms moving with noninertial motions and the strict relation with the Unruh effect, and on resonance interactions between entangled identical atoms in uniformly accelerated motion.</summary>

    <summary>We propose a quantum thermal machine composed of two nanomechanical resonators (NMR) (two membranes suspended over a trench in a substrate), placed a few $μ$m from each other. The quantum thermodynamical cycle is powered by the Casimir interaction between the resonators and the working fluid is the polariton resulting from the mixture of the flexural (out-of-plane) vibrations. With the help of piezoelectric cells, we select and sweep the polariton frequency cyclically. We calculate the performance of the proposed quantum thermal machines and show that high efficiencies are achieved thanks to (i) the strong coupling between the resonators and (ii) the large difference between the membrane stiffnesses. Our findings can be of particular importance for applications in nanomechanical technologies where a sensitive control of temperature is needed.</summary>
