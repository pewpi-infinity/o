    <summary>As demonstrated by Chernodub, vacuum in a strong magnetic field behaves as a periodic Abrikosov vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor. We investigate electromagnetic behavior of vacuum in this state. Since superconductivity is realized along the axis of magnetic field only, strong anisotropy of the vacuum dielectric tensor is observed. The diagonal components of the tensor are positive in the x and y directions perpendicular to the magnetic field, and negative in the z direction along the field. As a result, vacuum behaves as a hyperbolic metamaterial medium. If the magnetic field is constant, low frequency extraordinary photons experience this medium as a (3+1) Minkowski spacetime in which the role of time is played by the spatial z coordinate. Spatial variations of the magnetic field curve this effective spacetime, and may lead to formation of "event horizons", which are analogous to electromagnetic black holes in hyperbolic metamaterials. We also note that hyperbolic metamaterials behave as diffractionless "perfect lenses". Since large enough magnetic fields probably had arisen in the course of evolution of early Universe, the demonstrated hyperbolic behavior of early vacuum may have imprints in the large scale structure of the present-day Universe.</summary>

    <summary>  In the collision of a high-energy proton beam and a strong laser field, merging of the laser photons can occur due to the polarization of vacuum. The probability of photon merging is calculated by accounting exactly for the laser field and presents a highly non-perturbative dependence on the laser intensity and frequency. It is shown that the non-perturbative vacuum-polarization effects can be experimentally measured by combining the next-generation of table-top petawatt lasers with presently available proton accelerators.</summary>

    <title>Generation of harmonics by a focused laser beam in vacuum</title>

    <summary>  Generation of odd harmonics by a super strong focused laser beam in vacuum is considered. The process occurs due to the plural light-by-light scattering effect. In the leading order of perturbation theory, generation of $(2k+1)$th harmonic is described by a loop diagram with $(2k+2)$ external incoming, and two outgoing legs. A frequency of the beam is assumed to be much smaller than the Compton frequency, so that the approximation of a constant uniform electromagnetic field is valid locally. Analytical expressions for angular distribution of generated photons, as well as for their total emission rate are obtained in the leading order of perturbation theory. Influence of higher-order diagrams is studied numerically using the formalism of Intense Field QED. It is shown that the process may become observable for the beam intensity of the order of $10^{27}\rm{W/cm}^2$.</summary>
