    <summary>Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) was the first collective radiative instability, driven by confined fusion-born ions, observed from deuterium-tritium plasmas in JET and TFTR. ICE comprises strongly suprathermal emission, which has spectral peaks at multiple ion cyclotron harmonic frequencies as evaluated at the outer mid-plane edge of tokamak plasmas. The measured intensity of ICE spectral peaks scaled linearly with measured fusion reactivity in JET. In other large tokamak plasmas, ICE is currently used as an indicator of fast ions physics. The excitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI); in the case of JET and TFTR, the MCI is driven by a set of centrally born fusion products, lying just inside the trapped-passing boundary in velocity space, whose drift orbits make large radial excursions to the outer mid-plane edge. Diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future experiments therefore rests in part on deep understanding of the MCI, and recent advances in computational plasma physics have led to substantial recent progress, reviewed here.</summary>

    <title>Sandpile modelling of dual location fuelling in fusion plasmas</title>

    <summary>We modify the Chapman sandpile model (Chapman \textit{et al} \textit{Physical Review Letters} 86, 2814 (2001)) to form comparisons with pellet pacing, which is used to reduce or eliminate ELMs in a fusion plasma. We employ a variation of that model in which a pedestal with feedback is introduced (Bowie and Hole \textit{Phys. Plasmas} 25, 012511 (2018)), which we further modify to provide for dual fuelling - sand is added both at the centre of the sandpile, and near the edge. We observe that when the additional sand is added at the top of the pedestal, MLEs are largely suppressed. While this suppression comes at a cost by way of reduction in total energy confinement, that reduction is lower than the reduction in MLE size. The trade-off between MLE suppression and reduction in energy confinement depends not only on the amount of extra sand, but also on its precise location relative to the top of the pedestal. We suggest that the approach of constant dual fuelling may be equally applicable to plasmas, and may suggest a strategy for ELM suppression in fusion plasmas. We observe that when the proposed amount of extra sand is added in 'pellets', using frequencies and amounts based on those proposed for ELM suppression for ITER, MLEs are similarly suppressed, although MLEs are not significantly suppressed when the pellet rate does not substantially exceed the MLE frequency. This suggests that pellet injection at the top of the pedestal at small pellet size and high frequency may represent a reasonable physical proxy for our proposed scheme. However, our results suggest that it is not the synchronisation of pellets to ELM frequencies which is the key factor for ELM suppression in this regime, but rather the introduction of additional fuelling at the top of the pedestal.</summary>

    <summary>We have previously generated elongated Taylor double-helix flux rope plasmas in the SSX MHD wind tunnel. These plasmas are remarkable in their rapid relaxation (about one Alfvén time) and their description by simple analytical Taylor force-free theory despite their high plasma beta and high internal flow speeds. We report on the turbulent features observed in these plasmas including frequency spectra, autocorrelation function, and probability distribution functions of increments. We discuss here the possibility that the turbulence facilitating access to the final state supports coherent structures and intermittency revealed by non-Gaussian signatures in the statistics. Comparisons to a Hall-MHD simulation of the SSX MHD wind tunnel show similarity in several statistical measures.</summary>
