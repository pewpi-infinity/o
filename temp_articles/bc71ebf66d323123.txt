    <summary>We present the results of the symmetry classification of the electron energy bands in graphene and silicene using group theory algebra and the tight--binding approximation. The analysis is performed both in the absence and in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling. We also discuss the bands merging in the Brillouin zone symmetry points and the conditions for the latter to become Dirac points.</summary>

    <summary>The development of selective high precision chemical functionalization strategies for device fabrication, in conjunction with associated techniques for patterning graphene wafers with atomic accuracy would provide the necessary basis for a post-CMOS manufacturing technology. This requires a thorough understanding of the principles governing the reactivity and patterning of graphene at the sub-nanometer length scale. This article reviews our quest to delineate the principles of graphene chemistry - that is, the chemistry at the Dirac point and beyond, and the effect of covalent chemistry on the electronic structure, electrical transport and magnetic properties of this low-dimensional material in order to enable the scalable production of graphene-based devices for low- and high-end technology applications.</summary>

    <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of the graphene densely decorated with 3d metallic adatoms</title>

    <summary>The electronic properties of graphene decorated with Ni, Co, Cu and Zn adatoms is studied with the density functional theory approach. Within the analysis the spin-orbit interaction is taken into account. We focus on the case when the indicated $3d$ metallic adatoms form a perfect, close-packed single-atomic layer above the graphene surface. The two configurations are examined, namely the adatoms in the on-top, and the hollow positions on graphene. First, we verify that the metallic adatoms in the close-packed structure do not form a covalent bonds with the graphene substrate. However, due to the proximity of the metallic adatoms to the graphene, the charge transfer from the adatom layer to the graphene takes place, and in consequence the graphene becomes $n$-doped. The observed charge transfer results from the arising hybridization between the graphene $2p$ and transition metal $3d$ orbitals. The proximity of metallic adatoms modifies the magnetic state of the graphene. This effect is especially pronounced for the decoration with magnetic atoms, when the magnetic moments on the graphene sublattices are induced. The analysis of the band structure demonstrates that the charge transfer, as well as the induced magnetism on graphene, modify the graphene electronic properties near high symmetry points, especially the Dirac cones. The presence of the metallic adatoms breaks graphene $K-K^{'}$ symmetry and splits the bands due to the exchange coupling. We show that for the hollow configuration the gap opening arises at the $K(K^{'})$-point due to the Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction, while in the case of the on-top configuration the energy gap opens mainly due to the staggered potential. We also mapped the parameters of an effective Hamiltonian on the results obtained with the density functional theory approach.</summary>
