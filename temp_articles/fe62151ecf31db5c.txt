    <summary>Within the subgap of amorphous oxide semiconductors like amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) are donor-like and acceptor-like states that control the operational physics of optically transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs). Hydrogen incorporation into the channel layer of a top-gate a-IGZO TFT exists as an electron donor that causes an observed negative shift in the drain current-gate voltage ($\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$) transfer curve turn-on voltage. Normally, hydrogen is thought to create shallow electronic states just below the conduction band mobility edge, with the donor ionization state controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics involving the position of the Fermi level with respect to the donor ionization energy. However, hydrogen does not behave as a normal donor as revealed by the subgap density of states (DoS) measured by the photoconduction response of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs to within 0.3 eV of the CBM edge. Specifically, the DoS shows a subgap peak above the valence band mobility edge growing at the same rate that $\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$ transfer curve measurements suggest that hydrogen was incorporated into the channel layer. Such hydrogen donor behavior in a-IGZO is anomalous and can be understood as follows: Non-bonded hydrogen ionization precedes its incorporation into the a-IGZO network as a bonded species. Ionized hydrogen bonds to a charged oxygen-on-an-oxygen-site anion, resulting in the formation of a defect complex denoted herein as, $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$. Formation of an $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$ defect complex creates a spectrally-broad ($\sim$0.3 eV FWHM) distribution of electronic states observed in the bandgap centered at 0.4 eV above the valence band mobility edge.</summary>

    <title>Excitation and characterization of long-lived hydrogenic Rydberg states of nitric oxide</title>

    <summary>High Rydberg states of nitric oxide (NO) with principal quantum numbers between 40 and 100 and lifetimes in excess of 10 $μ$s have been prepared by resonance enhanced two-color two-photon laser excitation from the X $^2Π_{1/2}$ ground state through the A $^2Σ^+$ intermediate state. Molecules in these long-lived Rydberg states were detected and characterized 126 $μ$s after laser photoexcitation by state-selective pulsed electric field ionization. The laser excitation and electric field ionization data were combined to construct two-dimensional spectral maps. These maps were used to identify the rotational states of the NO$^+$ ion core to which the observed series of long-lived hydrogenic Rydberg states converge. The results presented pave the way for Rydberg-Stark deceleration and electrostatic trapping experiments with NO, which are expected to shed further light on the decay dynamics of these long-lived excited states, and are of interest for studies of ion-molecule reactions at low temperatures.</summary>

    <title>Chemical manipulation of hydrogen induced high p-type and n-type conductivity in Ga2O3</title>

    <summary>Advancement of optoelectronic and high-power devices is tied to the development of wide band gap materials with excellent transport properties. However, bipolar doping (n-type and p-type doping) and realizing high carrier density while maintaining good mobility have been big challenges in wide band gap materials. Here P-type and n-type conductivity was introduced in beta-Ga2O3, an ultra-wide band gap oxide, by controlling hydrogen incorporation in the lattice without further doping. Hydrogen induced a 9-order of magnitude increase of n-type conductivity with donor ionization energy of 20 meV and resistivity of 10-4 Ohm.cm. The conductivity was switched to p-type with acceptor ionization energy of 42 meV by altering hydrogen incorporation in the lattice. Density functional theory calculations were used to examine hydrogen location in the Ga2O3 lattice and identified a new donor type as the source of this remarkable n-type conductivity. Positron annihilation spectroscopy confirmed this finding and the interpretation of the results. This work illustrates a new approach that allows a tunable and reversible way of modifying the conductivity of semiconductors and it is expected to have profound implications on semiconductor field. At the same time it demonstrates for the first time p-type and remarkable n-type conductivity in Ga2O3 which should usher in the development of Ga2O3 devices and advance optoelectronics and high-power devices</summary>
