    <summary>The discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ -- a transition metal (TM) oxide that is both isostructural and isoelectronic to cuprate superconductors -- has lead to renewed enthusiasm in the hope of understanding the origin of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we investigate the electron-removal states in infinite-layered Ni$^{1+}$ oxide, NdNiO$_2$, which mimics hole-doping, with the state-of-the-art many-body multireference quantum chemistry methods. From the analysis of the many-body wavefunction, we find that the hole-doped $d^8$ ground state of NdNiO$_2$ is very different from the $d^8$ ground state in isostructural cuprate analog CaCuO$_2$, although the parent $d^9$ ground states are for the most part identical. We show that the doped hole in NdNiO$_2$ mainly localizes on the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital to form a closed-shell singlet, and this singlet configuration contributes to $\sim$40% of the wavefunction. In contrast, in CaCuO$_2$ the Zhang-Rice singlet configurations contribute to $\sim$65% of the wavefunction. With the help of the quantum information concept of entanglement entropy, we quantify the different types of electronic correlations in the nickelate and cuprate compounds and find that the dynamic radial-type correlations within the Ni $d$ manifold are persistent in hole-doped NdNiO$_2$. As a result, the $d^8$ multiplet effects are stronger and the additional hole foot-print is more three-dimensional in NdNiO$_2$. Our analysis shows that the most commonly used three-band Hubbard model employed to express the doped scenario in cuprates represents $\sim$90% of the $d^8$ wavefunction for CaCuO$_2$, but such a model grossly approximates the $d^8$ wavefunction for NdNiO$_2$ as it only stands for $\sim$60% of the wavefunction.</summary>

    <title>The High Temperature Superconductivity in Cuprates: Physics of the Pseudogap Region</title>

    <summary>We discuss the physics of the high temperature superconductivity in hole doped copper oxide ceramics in the pseudogap region. Starting from an effective reduced Hamiltonian relevant to the dynamics of holes injected into the copper oxide layers proposed in a previous paper, we determine the superconductive condensate wavefunction. We show that the low-lying elementary condensate excitations are analogous to the rotons in superfluid $^4He$. We argue that the rotons-like excitations account for the specific heat anomaly at the critical temperature. We discuss and compare with experimental observations the London penetration length, the Abrikosov vortices, the upper and lower critical magnetic fields, and the critical current density. We give arguments to explain the origin of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets. We investigate the nodal gap in the cuprate superconductors and discuss both the doping and temperature dependence of the nodal gap. We suggest that the nodal gap is responsible for the doping dependence of the so-called nodal Fermi velocity detected in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies. We discuss the thermodynamics of the nodal quasielectron liquid and their role in the low temperature specific heat. We propose that the ubiquitous presence of charge density wave in hole doped cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap region originates from instabilities of the nodal quasielectrons driven by the interaction with the planar $CuO_2$ lattice. We investigate the doping dependence of the charge density wave gap and the competition between charge order and superconductivity. We discuss the effects of external magnetic fields on the charge density wave gap and elucidate the interplay between charge density wave and Abrikosov vortices. Finally, we examine the physics underlying quantum oscillations in the pseudogap region.</summary>

    <title>BCS-BEC Crossover: From High Temperature Superconductors to Ultracold Superfluids</title>

    <summary>  We review the BCS to Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover scenario which is based on the well known crossover generalization of the BCS ground state wavefunction $Ψ_0$. While this ground state has been summarized extensively in the literature, this Review is devoted to less widely discussed issues: understanding the effects of finite temperature, primarily below $T_c$, in a manner consistent with $Ψ_0$. Our emphasis is on the intersection of two important problems: high $T_c$ superconductivity and superfluidity in ultracold fermionic atomic gases. We address the "pseudogap state" in the copper oxide superconductors from the vantage point of a BCS-BEC crossover scenario, although there is no consensus on the applicability of this scheme to high $T_c$. We argue that it also provides a useful basis for studying atomic gases near the unitary scattering regime; they are most likely in the counterpart pseudogap phase. That is, superconductivity takes place out of a non-Fermi liquid state where preformed, metastable fermion pairs are present at the onset of their Bose condensation. As a microscopic basis for this work, we summarize a variety of $T$-matrix approaches, and assess their theoretical consistency. A close connection with conventional superconducting fluctuation theories is emphasized and exploited.</summary>
