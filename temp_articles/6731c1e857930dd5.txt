    <summary>In this paper we study the charged electro-weak interactions in the de Sitter geometry. We develop the reduction formalism for the Proca field with the help of the solutions for the interacting fields. Perturbation theory is used for obtaining the definition of the transition amplitudes in the first order. We apply our formalism to the study of spontaneous vacuum emission of fermions, anti-fermions and $W^{\pm}$ bosons in the expanding de Sitter universe. Our results are generalizations of the Weinberg-Salam electro-weak theory to curved space-time, in the case of $W^{\pm}$ boson interaction with leptons. The probability and transition amplitude are found to be a quantities which depend on the Hubble parameter. Our analytical and graphical results prove that such perturbative processes are possible only for the large expansion conditions of the early Universe. The total probability and rate of transition are obtained for the case of large expansion and we use dimensional regularization and Pauli-Villars regularization for the momenta integrals. In the end we recover the Minkowski limit, where our probabilities vanish, thus confirming the well known fact that spontaneous vacuum emission of $W^{\pm}$ bosons and fermions is forbidden in flat space-time due to energy-momentum conservation.</summary>

    <summary>In this paper we study the problem of neutral electro-weak interactions in a de Sitter geometry. We develop the formalism of reduction for the Proca field with the help of the solutions for the interacting fields and by using perturbative methods we obtain the definition of the transition amplitudes in the first order of perturbation theory. As an application to our formalism we study the generation of massive fermions and Z bosons from vacuum in the expanding de Sitter universe. Our results are the generalization to the curved geometry of the Weinberg-Salam electro-weak theory for the case of Z boson interaction with leptons. The probability is found to be a quantity that depends on the Hubble parameter and we prove that such perturbative processes are possible only for large expansion regime of the early Universe. The total probability and rate of transition are obtained for the case of large expansion and we use the dimensional regularization for extract finite results from the momenta integrals. In the Minkowski limit we obtain that the probability of particle generation from vacuum is vanishing recovering the well known result that forbids particle production in flat space-time due to the momentum-energy conservation.</summary>

    <title>False vacuum as an unstable state: possible cosmological implications</title>

    <summary>Recent LHC results concerning the mass of the Higgs boson  indicate that the vacuum in our Universe may be  unstable. We analyze properties of unstable  vacuum states from the point of view of the quantum theory  of unstable states. From the literature it is known that some of false vacuum  states may survive up to times when their survival probability has a non-exponential form. At times much latter than the transition time, when contributions to the survival probability  of its exponential and non-exponential parts are comparable,  the survival probability as a function of time $t$ has an  inverse power-like form. We show that at this time region  the instantaneous energy of the false vacuum states tends  to the energy of the true vacuum state as $1/t^{2}$ for  $t \to \infty$. Properties of the instantaneous energy  at transition times are also analyzed for a given model.  It is shown that at this time region large and rapid  fluctuations of the instantaneous energy take place.  This suggests analogous behavior of the cosmological  constant at these time regions.</summary>
