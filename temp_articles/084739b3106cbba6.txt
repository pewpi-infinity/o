    <summary>An effective method for increasing the electrocatalytic activity of metallic glasses (MGs) in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. This method applies a noble metal hybridization strategy to design a highly reactive catalyst for alkaline HER based on MGs with a nano-porous structure. The porous structure provides an abundance of active sites and exposes a large specific surface area to the electrolyte, thus effectively improving the activity of the HER catalysts. The doping of Au element can create electronic defects, adjust the electronic structure, change the electronic interaction, introduce lattice distortion, regulate mixing entropy, and improve the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. All these properties make np-AlMnYNiCoAu catalyst a potential electrode for alkaline HER. Significantly, we find that the high mixing entropy can enhance the HER performances. The present work could lead to a new approach to further develop environmentally friendly amorphous electrocatalyst with high efficiency and excellent stability for HER in alkaline solution.</summary>

    <title>Electronic structure, metamagnetism and thermopower of LaSiFe$_{12}$ and interstitially doped LaSiFe$_{12}$</title>

    <summary>We present a systematic investigation of the effect of H, B, C, and N interstitials on the electronic, lattice and magnetic properties of La(Fe,Si)$_{13}$ using density functional theory. The parent LaSiFe$_{12}$ alloy has a shallow, double-well free energy function that is the basis of itinerant metamagnetism. On increasing the dopant concentration, the resulting lattice expansion causes an initial increase in magnetisation for all interstitials that is only maintained at higher levels of doping in the case of hydrogen. Strong s-p band hybridisation occurs at high B,C and N concentrations. We thus find that the electronic effects of hydrogen doping are much less pronounced than those of other interstitials, and result in the double-well structure of the free energy function being least sensitive to the amount of hydrogen. This microscopic picture accounts for the vanishing first order nature of the transition by B,C, and N dopants as observed experimentally. We use our calculated electronic density of states for LaSiFe$_{12}$ and the hydrogenated alloy to infer changes in magneto-elastic coupling and in phonon entropy on heating through $T_C$ by calculating the fermionic entropy due to the itinerant electrons. Lastly, we predict the electron thermopower in a spin-mixing, high temperature limit and compare our findings to recent literature data.</summary>

    <title>Matchings and entropies of cylinders</title>

    <summary>  The enumeration of perfect matchings of graphs is equivalent to the dimer problem which has applications in statistical physics. A graph $G$ is said to be $n$-rotation symmetric if the cyclic group of order $n$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of $G$. Jockusch (Perfect matchings and perfect squares, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 67(1994), 100-115) and Kuperberg (An exploration of the permanent-determinant method, Electron. J. Combin., 5(1998), #46) proved independently that if $G$ is a plane bipartite graph of order $N$ with $2n$-rotation symmetry, then the number of perfect matchings of $G$ can be expressed as the product of $n$ determinants of order $N/2n$. In this paper we give this result a new presentation. We use this result to compute the entropy of a bulk plane bipartite lattice with $2n$-notation symmetry. We obtain explicit expressions for the numbers of perfect matchings and entropies for two types of cylinders. Using the results on the entropy of the torus obtained by Kenyon, Okounkov, and Sheffield (Dimers and amoebae, Ann. Math. 163(2006), 1019--1056) and by Salinas and Nagle (Theory of the phase transition in the layered hydrogen-bonded $SnCl^2\cdot 2H_2O$ crystal, Phys. Rev. B, 9(1974), 4920--4931), we show that each of the cylinders considered and its corresponding torus have the same entropy. Finally, we pose some problems.</summary>
