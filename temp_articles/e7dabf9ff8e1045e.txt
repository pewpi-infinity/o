    <summary>  It is suggested that charged tachyons of extremely large mass M could not only contribute to the dark matter needed to fit astrophysical observations, but could also provide an explanation for gamma ray bursts and ulta high energy cosmic rays. The present paper defines a quantum field theory of tachyons, particles similar to ordinary leptons, but with momenta larger than energy. The theory is invariant under the full CPT transformation, but separately violates P and T invariance. Micro causality is broken for space-time intervals smaller than 1/M, but is effectively preserved for larger separations. Charged fermionic, rather than charged scalar tachyons are considered in order to minimize the probability of Cerenkov-like radiation by the tachyon, thereby permitting a high energy tachyon to retain its energy over galactic distances. Topics treated include the choice and Schwinger Action Principle variations of an appropriate Lagrangian, spinorial wave functions, relevant Green's functions, a functional description of an S-Matrix and generating functional, and a variety of interesting kinematical processes, including photon emission and reabsorption, and relevant annihilation and scattering effects. A version of Ehrenfest's theorem is developed, in order to provide a foundation for a classical description of charged tachyons in an external electromagnetic field. Applications are then made to three outstanding astrophysical puzzles : dark matter, gamma ray bursts and ultra high energy cosmic rays.</summary>

    <title>Towards the Classification of Tachyon-Free Models From Tachyonic Ten-Dimensional Heterotic String Vacua</title>

    <summary>Recently it was proposed that ten-dimensional tachyonic string vacua may serve as starting points for the construction of viable four dimensional phenomenological string models which are tachyon free. This is achieved by projecting out the tachyons in the four-dimensional models using projectors other than the projector which is utilised in the supersymmetric models and those of the $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic string. We continue the exploration of this class of models by developing systematic computerised tools for their classification, the analysis of their tachyonic and massless spectra, as well as analysis of their partition functions and vacuum energy. We explore a randomly generated space of $2\times10^9$ string vacua in this class and find that tachyon--free models occur with $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ probability, and of those, phenomenologically inclined $SO(10)$ vacua with $a_{00}=N_b^0-N_f^0=0$, i.e. equal number of fermionic and bosonic massless states, occur with frequency $\sim 2\times 10^{-6}$. Extracting larger numbers of phenomenological vacua therefore requires adaptation of fertility conditions that we discuss, and significantly increase the frequency of tachyon--free models. Our results suggest that spacetime supersymmetry may not be a necessary ingredient in phenomenological string models, even at the Planck scale.</summary>

    <title>Dynamical System Analysis of Randall-Sundrum Model with Tachyon Field on the Brane</title>

    <summary>In this manuscript we use the dynamical system approach to study the linear dynamics of a Randall-Sundrum braneworld model with a tachyon scalar field confined to the brane. We recognize that the form of the tachyon potential plays a significant role in the evolution of the universe. For the case of an inverse square potential we find that one of our new variables, $λ$, is constant. We obtain critical points of the system in this situation and investigate their stability using the linear perturbation method. Then we turn to a Gaussian potential in which $λ$ is not constant. Using the idea of instantaneous critical points we study the behavior of the universe and its possible fates. One of the interesting results of this manuscript is that our universe will probably experience another phase transition from acceleration to deceleration in the future.</summary>
