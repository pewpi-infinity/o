    <summary>  When wavefunction of crystal was projected out in atomic basis, we found that electrons of s orbital had localization-delocalization duality, and the ones of p and d orbital were only localized in three dimensional crystal lattice. The existence of s type delocalized electrons is based on three dimensional ordering of electron density in metals. Then charge carriers of metals for conductivity are just such delocalized electrons so that the ones for superconductivity are electron pairs of s wave. This way could also be generalized to two dimensional case for CuO2 plane of cuprate superconductor to explain its phase diagram qualitatively. We also gave some ab initio explain for Hubbard model.</summary>

    <title>Apparent increase in the thickness of superconducting particles at low temperatures measured by electron holography</title>

    <summary>We predict that superconducting particles will show an apparent increase in thickness at low temperatures when measured by electron holography. This will result not from a real thickness increase, rather from an increase in the mean inner potential sensed by the electron wave traveling through the particle, originating in expansion of the electronic wavefunction and resulting negative charge expulsion from the interior to the surface of the superconductor, giving rise to an increase in the phase shift of the electron wavefront going through the sample relative to the wavefront going through vacuum. The temperature dependence of the observed phase shifts will yield valuable new information on the physics of the superconducting state of metals.</summary>

    <title>Momentum of superconducting electrons and the explanation of the Meissner effect</title>

    <summary>Momentum and energy conservation are fundamental tenets of physics, that valid physical theories have to satisfy. In the reversible transformation between superconducting and normal phases in the presence of a magnetic field, the mechanical momentum of the supercurrent has to be transferred to the body as a whole and vice versa, the kinetic energy of the supercurrent stays in the electronic degrees of freedom, and no energy is dissipated nor entropy is generated in the process. We argue on general grounds that to explain these processes it is necessary that the electromagnetic field mediates the transfer of momentum between electrons and the body as a whole, and this requires that when the phase boundary between normal and superconducting phases is displaced, a flow and counterflow of charge occurs in direction perpendicular to the phase boundary. This flow and counterflow does not occur according to the conventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity, therefore we argue that within BCS-London theory the Meissner transition is a `forbidden transition'. Furthermore, to explain the phase transformation in a way that is consistent with the experimental observations requires that (i) the wavefunction $and$ charge distribution of superconducting electrons near the phase boundary extend into the normal phase, and (ii) that the charge carriers in the normal state have hole-like character. The conventional theory of superconductivity does not have these physical elements, the theory of hole superconductivity does.</summary>
