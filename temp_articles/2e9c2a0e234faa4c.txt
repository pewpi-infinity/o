    <summary>There is renewed interest in using the coherence between beams generated in separate down-converter sources for new applications in imaging, spectroscopy, microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). These schemes make use of continuous wave (CW) pumping in the low parametric gain regime, which produces frequency correlations, and frequency entanglement, between signal-idler pairs generated in each single source. But can induced coherence still be observed if there is no frequency correlation, so the biphoton wavefunction is factorable? We will show that this is the case, and this might be an advantage for OCT applications. High axial resolution requires a large bandwidth. For CW pumping this requires the use of short nonlinear crystals. This is detrimental since short crystals generate small photon fluxes. We show that the use of ultrashort pump pulses allows improving axial resolution even for long crystal that produce higher photon fluxes.</summary>

    <summary>Central to quantum theory, the wavefunction is the complex distribution used to completely describe a quantum system. Despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via the Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through tomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way (i.e. weak measurement) so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable both to other degrees of freedom of the photon (e.g. polarization, frequency, etc.) and to other quantum systems (e.g. electron spin-z quantum state, SQUIDs, trapped ions, etc.). Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations. We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems scientists are able to characterize and initiate new avenues to understand fundamental quantum theory.</summary>

    <title>Measurement of long-range wavefunction correlations in an open microwave billiard</title>

    <summary>  We investigate the statistical properties of wavefunctions in an open chaotic cavity. When the number of channels in the openings of the billiard is increased by varying the frequency, wavefunctions cross over from real to complex. The distribution of the phase rigidity, which characterizes the degree to which a wavefunction is complex, and long-range correlations of intensity and current density are studied as a function of the number of channels in the openings. All measured quantities are in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions.</summary>
