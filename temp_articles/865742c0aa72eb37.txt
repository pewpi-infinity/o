    <summary>  We predict a new mechanism for the spin light of neutrino ($SLν$) that can be emitted by a neutrino moving in gravitational fields. This effect is studied on the basis of the quasiclassical equation for the neutrino spin evolution in a gravitational field. It is shown that the gravitational field of a rotating object, in the weak-field limit, can be considered as an axial vector external field which induces the neutrino spin procession. The corresponding probability of the neutrino spin oscillations in the gravitational field has been derived for the first time. The considered in this paper $SLν$ can be produced in the neutrino spin-flip transitions in gravitational fields. It is shown that the total power of this radiation is proportional to the neutrino gamma factor to the fourth power, and the emitted photon energy, for the case of an ultra relativistic neutrino, could span up to gamma-rays. We investigate the $SLν$ caused by both gravitational and electromagnetic fields, also accounting for effects of arbitrary moving and polarized matter, in various astrophysical environments. In particular, we discuss the $SLν$ emitted by a neutrino moving in the vicinity of a rotating neutron star, black hole surrounded by dense matter, as well as by a neutrino propagating in the relativistic jet from a quasar.</summary>

    <summary>We present neutrino bulb model simulations of Majorana neutrino coherent spin transformation (i.e., neutrino-antineutrino transformation), coupled to neutrino flavor evolution, for conditions corresponding to the neutronization burst epoch of an Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium (O-Ne-Mg) core collapse supernova. Significant neutrino spin transformation in, for example, the neutronization burst, could alter the fluences of neutrinos and antineutrinos in a way which is potentially detectable for a Galactic core collapse supernova. Our calculations for the first time incorporate geometric dilution in the spin evolution of the neutrinos and combine two-flavor and three-flavor evolution with spin mixing physics. We find that significant spin transformations can occur, but only with a large neutrino luminosity and an electron fraction ($Y_e$) profile which facilitates adiabatic conditions for the spin-channel resonance. Using our adopted parameters of neutrino energy spectra, luminosity, density and $Y_e$ profiles, our calculations require an unrealistically large neutrino rest mass to sustain the spin transformation. It is an open question whether examining different density profiles or incorporating other sources of nonlinear feedback, such as $Y_e$ feedback, could mitigate this need. We find that spin transformations are not sensitive to the flavor structure of neutrinos, i.e., the spin transformations occur regardless of whether we simulate two- or three-flavor transformations. In the two-flavor case, spin transformations were insensitive to the choice of solar or atmospheric mass-squared splitting as well as the choice of the Majorana phase. Importantly, our three-flavor simulations, as well as our two-flavor simulations done with the atmospheric mass-squared splitting, show that the inclusion of spin degrees of freedom can significantly and qualitatively alter neutrino flavor evolution.</summary>

    <title>Zero-spin-photon hypothesis: `Zero-spin-photon generation in pair-production and its subsequent decay into neutrino and antineutrino' - solves many-riddles of physics and universe</title>

    <summary>  `What is work and what is heat' is re-investigated from the perspective of second law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the inevitable consequence of second law of thermodynamics and spin conservation necessitates the possible generation of zero spin photon in pair production process, and its subsequent decay explains the birth of neutrino and antineutrino. The proposed neutrino-genesis, solves many riddles of physics and universe. The riddles considered and explained are about: (i) mysterious neutrino (and antineutrino) and its bizarre properties such as handed-ness and parity-violation, (ii) questionable asymmetry/ excess of matter over antimatter, (iii) possibility of existence of antimatter world and (iv) parity (P) violation and aspects of CP and CPT violation or restoration in the universe.</summary>
