    <summary>We propose a compact perturbative approach that reveals the physical origin of the singularity occurring in the density dependence of correlation energy: like fermions, elementary bosons have a singular correlation energy which comes from the accumulation, through Feynman "bubble" diagrams, of the same non-zero momentum transfer excitations from the free particle ground state, that is, the Fermi sea for fermions and the Bose-Einstein condensate for bosons. This understanding paves the way toward deriving the correlation energy of composite bosons like atomic dimers and semiconductor excitons, by suggesting Shiva diagrams that have similarity with Feynman "bubble" diagrams, the previous elementary boson approaches, which hide this physics, being difficult to do so.</summary>

    <summary>The discovery or exclusion of the fundamental standard scalar is a hot topic, given the data of LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC, as well as the advanced status of the pertinent theoretical calculations. With the current statistics at the hadron colliders, the workhorse decay channel, at all relevant H masses, is H to WW, followed by W to light leptons. Using phase-space singularity techniques, we construct and study a plethora of "singularity variables" meant to facilitate the difficult tasks of separating signal and backgrounds and of measuring the mass of a putative signal. The simplest singularity variables are not invariant under boosts along the collider's axes and the simulation of their distributions requires a good understanding of parton distribution functions, perhaps not a serious shortcoming during the boson hunting season. The derivation of longitudinally boost-invariant variables, which are functions of the four charged-lepton observables that share this invariance, is quite elaborate. But their use is simple and they are, in a kinematical sense, optimal.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Phase Transition Induced by a Preformed Pair in a Boson-Fermion Model of Fulleride Superconductivity</title>

    <summary>  There continues to be enormous interest in the BCS to BEC transition as there still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance) superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW) isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair) has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a Feshbach resonance form of SC.</summary>
