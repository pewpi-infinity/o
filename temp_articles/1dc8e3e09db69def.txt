    <summary>  The pioneering works by Eagles, Leggett, and Nozieres/Schmitt-Rink (reviewed and augmented by Randeria) emphasize that in the limits of the models studied both at T = 0 and, the cross-over from a BCS-type to a BEC-type superconductor is continuous. The BCS and BEC end points seem to be well-established. However, in the intermediate region, home to fulleride and high temperature superconductors, considerable extrapolation of the models must be done as there still is no exact theory. Yet, considerable current literature is devoted to what appears to be more singular-type phenomena such as quantum critical points, stripe formation, insulator to superconductor phase transitions, loss of validity of the Fermi liquid theory, etc.
  Using a connection we have made with cold atom Fermion-Boson crossover theory, we can establish that the resonance previously discussed is a result of the crossing of the Fermion band by the Boson band. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous, the collective modes due to the resonance transform the nature of the superconductivity. We discuss features of the resonance and the experimentally observed pre-formed BEC Cooper pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion resonance theory. In addition some of the various singular phenomena discussed above can be put into perspective.

    <summary>The maximum critical temperature for superconductivity in pressurized hydrides appears at the top of superconducting domes in Tc versus pressure curves at a particular pressure, which is not predicted by standard superconductivity theories. The a high-order anisotropic van Hove singularity near the Fermi level observed in band structure calculations of pressurized sulfur hydride, typical of a supermetal, has been associated with the array of metallic hydrogen wires modules forming a nanoscale heterostructure at atomic limit called superstripes phase. Here we propose that pressurized sulfur hydrides behave as a heterostructure made of a nanoscale superlattice of interacting quantum wires with a multicomponent electronic structure. We present first-principles quantum calculation of a universal superconducting dome where Tc amplification in multi-gap superconductivity is driven by the Fano-Feshbach resonance due to configuration interaction between open and closed pairing channels, i.e., between multiple gaps in the BCS regime, resonating with a single gap in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. In the proposed three dimensional (3D) phase diagram the critical temperature shows a superconducting dome where Tc is a function of two variables (i) the Lifshitz parameter ($η$) measuring the separation of the chemical potential from the Lifshitz transition normalized by the inter-wires coupling and (ii) the effective electron phonon coupling (g) in the appearing new Fermi surface including phonon softening. The results will be of help for material design of room temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.</summary>

    <title>Enhanced superconductivity in ultrathin FeSe films on SrTiO3 via resonant anti-shielding: Superconductivity meets superfluidity</title>

    <summary>A vanishingly small dielectric function reflects a singular polarization response in a medium, leading to collective plasmonic or polaronic excitations that can enhance Cooper pairing in superconductors via a resonant anti-shielding (RAS) effect. Here, we show that RAS can explain the dramatic enhancement of superconductivity-relative to bulk FeSe, observed in single-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and related substrates. Moreover, we present evidence that RAS may play a central role in driving the Cooper pair condensate into a bipolaronic superfluid state. This interpretation aligns with a recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation by Zhang, et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 011010 (2023)], which indicated enhanced bipolaronic superconductivity in two-dimensional systems with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. RAS may therefore represent a promising strategy for engineering high-T$_c$ superconducting heterostructures.</summary>
