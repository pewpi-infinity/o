    <summary>Phonon spectra of solid substitutional solutions with finite concentrations of impurities were analyzed on the microscopic level. The local phonon densities of impurity atoms were calculated, in particular the formation of quasilocal vibrations and their evolution with increasing of the concentration of impurities were investigated. Modification of the local spectral densities of atoms of the host lattice by impurities and manifestation of the phonon Ioffe-Regel crossover (scattering of fast propagating phonons on quasi-localized vibrations) were analyzed. It is shown that such scattering causes the manifestation of the features such as "boson peak" in the phonon spectrum of solid substitutional solutions. A commonality of the physical nature of such singularities in disordered structures and van Hove singularities in ideal crystals was established, notably, reducing of the group velocity of acoustic phonons due to their scattering on slow phonons.</summary>

    <summary>Despite extensive theoretical \cite{GanterPRL1998, ElliotPRL2001,SchirmacherPRL2007, TanakaNatureM2008, MonacoPNAS2009, MarruzzoSCIRP2013} and experimental studies \cite{ChumakovPRL2011, ChumakovPRL2014, KayaScience2010,KChenPRL2010, LXuPRL2012, BonnPreprint2014}, a longstanding puzzle in condensed matter physics remains regarding the origin and nature of "Boson peak" (BP), where the vibrational density of states (DOS) in glasses possesses an excess of states compared with the crystalline counterpart. Here we show that BP is successfully observed in 2D hexagonal granular packing, where the disorder is due to the force network, i.e. the spatial heterogeneity of elasticity \cite{MarruzzoSCIRP2013}. Using photo-elastic techniques \cite{TrushNature2005}, the disordered particle interaction can be precisely measured to resolve the origin and nature of BP for the first time in a real scenario. We discover the structures of DOS of disordered crystals reminiscent of the corresponding perfect crystals, which is consistent with the recent studies in $SiO_2$\cite{ChumakovPRL2014} and in disordered gels\cite{LorenzoGelPaper2011}, notwithstanding the drastically different systems. Moreover, we propose a mechanism to clarify that BP is not merely a broadened and shifted van Hove singularity \cite{ElliotPRL2001, ChumakovPRL2011} but instead it is due to an interplay of the mesoscopic screening effect and the microscopic elasticity disorder -- causing, respectively, the broadening and the attenuation of the first and the second van Hove singularity. This may lead to an in-depth understanding of BP in structure glasses.</summary>

    <title>Structural origins of the boson peak in metals: From high-entropy alloys to metallic glasses</title>

    <summary>The boson peak appears in all amorphous solids and is an excess of vibrational states at low frequencies compared to the phonon spectrum of the corresponding crystal. Until recently, the consensus was that it originated from "defects" in the glass. The nature of these defects is still under discussion, but the picture of regions with locally disturbed short-range order and/or decreased elastic constants has gained some traction. Recently, a different theory was proposed: The boson peak was attributed to the first van Hove singularity of crystal lattices which is only smeared out by the disorder. This new viewpoint assumes that the van Hove singularity is simply shifted by the decreased density of the amorphous state and is therefore not a glass-specific anomaly. In order to resolve this issue, we use computer models of a four-component alloy, alternatively with chemical disorder (high-entropy alloy), structural disorder, and reduced density. Comparison to a reference glass of the same composition reveals that the boson peak consists of additional vibrational modes which can be induced solely by structural disorder. While chemical disorder introduces fluctuations of the elastic constants, we find that those do not lead to sufficient local softening to induce these modes. A boson peak due to a reduction of density could be excluded for the present metallic system.</summary>
