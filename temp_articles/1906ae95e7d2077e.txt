    <summary>Field-effect transistors made of wide-bandgap semiconductors can operate at high voltages, temperatures and frequencies with low energy losses, and have been of increasing importance in power and high-frequency electronics. However, the poor performance of p-channel transistors compared with that of n-channel transistors has constrained the production of energy-efficient complimentary circuits with integrated n- and p-channel transistors. The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond offers great potential for solving this problem, but surface transfer doping, which is commonly believed to be essential for generating the conductivity, limits the performance of transistors made of hydrogen-terminated diamond because it requires the presence of ionized surface acceptors, which cause hole scattering. Here, we report on fabrication of a p-channel wide-bandgap heterojunction field-effect transistor consisting of a hydrogen-terminated diamond channel and hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) gate insulator, without relying on surface transfer doping. Despite its reduced density of surface acceptors, the transistor has the lowest sheet resistance ($1.4$ k$Ω$) and largest on-current ($1600$ $μ$m mA mm$^{-1}$) among p-channel wide-bandgap transistors, owing to the highest hole mobility (room-temperature Hall mobility: $680$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$). Importantly, the transistor also shows normally-off behavior, with a high on/off ratio exceeding $10^8$. These characteristics are suited for low-loss switching and can be explained on the basis of standard transport and transistor models. This new approach to making diamond transistors paves the way to future wide-bandgap semiconductor electronics.</summary>

    <summary>TMDs are a new family of 2D materials with features that make them appealing for potential applications in nanomaterials science and engineering. Although, the edges of the 2D TMDs show excellent electrocatalytic performance, their basal plane is inert which hinders the industrial applications for electrocatalysis. Here, we have computationally designed the 2D monolayer MoSe$_2$ and studied its electronic properties with electrocatalytic activities. Pt-atom has been doped in the pristine 2D MoSe$_2$ to activate the inert basal plane resulting zero bandgap. This study reveals that the Pt-MoSe$_2$ is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the aid of the DFT. Periodic hybrid DFT method has been applied to compute the electronic properties of both the pristine MoSe$_2$ and Pt-MoSe$_2$. To determine both the HER and ORR mechanisms on the surface of the Pt-MoSe2 material, a non-periodic DFT calculation has been performed by considering a molecular Pt1-Mo$_9$Se${21}$ cluster model. The present study shows that the 2D Pt-MoSe$_2$ follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER with the energy barriers about 9.29 kcal/mol and 10.55 kcal.mol-1 during the H-migration and Heyrovsky reactions. The ORR is achieved by four-electron transfer mechanism with the formation of two transition energy barriers about 14.94 kcal/mol and 11.10 kcal/mol, respectively. The lower energy barriers and high turnover frequency during the reactions expose that the Pt-MoSe$_2$ can be adopted as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and ORR. The present studies demonstrate that the exceptional HER and ORR activity and stability performance shown by the MoSe$_2$ electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Pt-doping, opening a promising concept for the sensible design of high-performance catalyst for H2 production and O2 reduction.</summary>

    <summary>By using density functional theory, we have studied vibrational features, Raman activities, and electronic properties of ultrathin hydrogen-passivated diamond nanowires (H-DNWs). Confinement imposes the softening of transverse acoustic modes and the hardening of the low-optical modes. Higher frequencies optical modes are more influenced by the surface termination effect. Surface effect splits transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) optical modes with a redshift from the bulk diamond. Electronic inspection shows that the surface terminated hydrogen atoms have the main contribution to the conduction bands of H-DNWs. This causes, contrary to our expectations from the quantum confinement effect, the electronic bandgap of H-DNWs becomes smaller than bulk diamond.</summary>
