    <summary>Two-dimensional porous carbon nanomaterials are proven to be promising hydrogen storage substrates as they possess high surface area, large number of active sites, low molecular mass, and hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed on both sides of these materials. By performing first-principles density functional theory-based calculations, we report ultrahigh reversible hydrogen uptake in lithium decorated 2D carbon allotrope PAI-graphene, which is formed of a regular pattern of polymerized as-indacenes (PAI). We found that a single unit cell of PAI-graphene can be decorated by 8 Li atoms, in which each Li atom can reversibly adsorb 4 hydrogen molecules, leading to 15.7 % of H uptake, remarkably higher than the DOE demand of 6.5 %. Li atom donates its valence 2s-electron to PAI-graphene and gets ionized. The adsorption energies of the various H2 attached to Li-atom are found to be suitable for reversible use during practical applications. Hydrogen molecules get attached to the ionized metal atom by electrostatic interactions. An energy barrier of 1.48 eV is present for the diffusion of Li atoms between the two most stable adsorption sites which justifies the absence of the clustering of Li atoms.</summary>

    <title>Electronic and Optical Properties of the Narrowest Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons Studied by Density Functional Methods</title>

    <summary>In the present study, a series of planar poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) oligomers with n phenyl rings (n = 1 - 20), designated as n-PP, are taken as finite-size models of the narrowest armchair graphene nanoribbons with hydrogen passivation. The singlet-triplet energy gap, vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity, fundamental gap, optical gap, and exciton binding energy of n-PP are calculated using Kohn-Sham density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory with various exchange-correlation density functionals. The ground state of n-PP is shown to be singlet for all the chain lengths studied. In contrast to the lowest singlet state (i.e., the ground state), the lowest triplet state and the ground states of the cation and anion of n-PP are found to exhibit some multi-reference character. Overall, the electronic and optical properties of n-PP obtained from the omegaB97 and omegaB97X functionals are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.</summary>

    <title>Tuning the pH Response of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride/Graphene Field-Effect Transistors</title>

    <summary>The chemical activity of ionized hydrogen describes the potency of protons in solution and is used to define the pH with wide-ranging applications in biological and materials sciences. Measuring pH with graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) has been described in the past but has yet to be characterized with a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. hBN capping is hypothesized to lower the chemical affinity of protons to oxidized defects in the graphene crystal and lower the standard deviation of pH measurement via screening charge density. First, the electronic properties of commercial, monolayer graphene and monolayer hBN/graphene, both on four-inch 90 nm SiO2/p-type Si, were contrasted as a function of solutal pH in 10 mM phosphate buffered solution. The two-dimensional (2D) FETs were fabricated with photoresistless metallization followed by microcentrifuge tube-masking and reactive ion etching to define a quasi-pure 2D sensing mesa for pH sensing. Thereafter, the devices were exposed to phosphate buffer of varying pH and the resistance and liquid-transfer characteristics measured. The hBN/graphene/SiO2 FETs had higher linearity, and both lower standard deviation and range of Dirac voltage shifting than monolayer graphene/SiO2. Then, before microcentrifuge tube-masking, freshly metallized devices were coated with 9 nm of Al2O3 by electron beam deposition. The Al2O3/graphene/SiO2 and Al2O3/hBN/graphene/SiO2 devices showed an altered response to the pH of the phosphate buffered solutions before and after basic etching of the Al2O3 with NaOH (pH = 12). This prompted studying the pH-dependencies of the 2D devices as a function of the thickness of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition. These results show that modifying the surface of monolayer graphene with nanoscale dielectrics enables tuning of the pH-dependent electronic properties of graphene pH sensors.</summary>
