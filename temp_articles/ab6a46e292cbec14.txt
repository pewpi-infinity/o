    <summary>The growth of graphene on copper by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition in a system free of pumping equipment is investigated. The emphasis is put on the necessity of hydrogen presence during graphene synthesis and cooling. In the absence of hydrogen during the growth step or cooling at slow rate, weak carbon coverage, consisting mostly of oxidized and amorphous carbon, is obtained on the copper catalyst. The oxidation originates from the inevitable occurrence of residual oxidizing impurities in the reactor's atmosphere. Graphene with appreciable coverage can be grown within the vacuum-free furnace only upon admitting hydrogen during the growth step. After formation, it is preserved from the destructive effect of residual oxidizing contaminants once exposure at high temperature is minimized by fast cooling or hydrogen flow. Under these conditions, micrometer-sized hexagon-shaped graphene domains of high structural quality are achieved.</summary>

    <summary>The Moon-forming giant impact extensively melts and partially vaporizes the silicate Earth and delivers a substantial mass of metal to Earth's core. Subsequent evolution of the magma ocean and overlying atmosphere has been described by theoretical models but observable constraints on this epoch have proved elusive. Here, we report calculations of the primordial atmosphere during the magma ocean and water ocean epochs and forge new links with observations to gain insight into the behavior of volatiles on the early Earth. As Earth's magma ocean crystallizes, it outgasses the bulk of the volatiles into the primordial atmosphere. The redox state of the magma ocean controls both the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen isotopic composition of water oceans that remain after hydrogen loss from the primordial atmosphere. Whereas water condenses and is retained, molecular hydrogen does not condense and can escape, allowing large quantities (~10^2 bars) of hydrogen - if present - to be lost from Earth in this epoch. Because the escaping inventory of H can be comparable to the hydrogen inventory in the early oceans, the corresponding deuterium enrichment can be large with a magnitude that depends on the initial H2 inventory. By contrast, the common view that terrestrial water has a carbonaceous chondrite source requires the oceans to preserve the isotopic composition of that source, undergoing minimal D-enrichment via H2 loss. Such minimal enrichment places upper limits on the amount of primordial H2 in contact with early water oceans (pH2&lt;20 bars), implies oxidizing conditions for outgassing from the magma ocean, and suggests that Earth's mantle supplied the oxidant for the chemical resorption of metals during late accretion.</summary>

    <title>Evaluation of the hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in proton-conducting oxides by converting the PSL values of a tritium imaging plate</title>

    <summary>Proton-conducting oxides have potential applications in hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, and other electrochemical devices including the tritium purification and recovery systems of nuclear fusion reactors. Although the distribution of hydrogen (H) in such oxide materials is an important aspect, its precise measurement is difficult. In the present study, the hydrogen solubility and diffusivity behavior of BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY), BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) were studied using tritiated heavy water vapor i.e., DTO (~2 kPa, tritium (T) = 0.1%) by converting the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) values of the imaging plate (IP). The samples were exposed to DTO vapor at 673 K for 2 h or at 873 K for 1 h. The disc-shaped oxide specimens (diameter ~7.5 mm; thickness ~2.3 mm; theoretical density (TD) &gt; 98 %) were prepared by conventional powder metallurgy. The IP images of the specimen surfaces of all the three materials T-exposed revealed that BZY showed the most uniform T distribution with the highest tritium activity. The cross-sectional T concentration profiles of the cut specimens showed that T diffused deeper into BZY and BZYC than into CZI. The hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in the CZI specimen were lower than that in the BZY and BZYC specimens. This suggested that barium zirconates were more favorable proton conductors than calcium zirconates.</summary>
