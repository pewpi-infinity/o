    <summary>A search for new-physics resonances decaying into a lepton and a jet performed by the ATLAS experiment is presented. Scalar leptoquarks pair-produced in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider are considered using an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$, corresponding to the full Run 2 dataset. They are searched for in events with two electrons or two muons and two or more jets, including jets identified as arising from the fragmentation of $c$- or $b$-quarks. The observed yield in each channel is consistent with the Standard Model background expectation. Leptoquarks with masses below 1.8 TeV and 1.7 TeV are excluded in the electron and muon channels, respectively, assuming a branching ratio into a charged lepton and a quark of 100%, with minimal dependence on the quark flavour. Upper limits on the aforementioned branching ratio are also given as a function of the leptoquark mass.</summary>

    <title>Search for a heavy resonance decaying into a Z and a Higgs boson in events with an energetic jet and two electrons, two muons, or missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

    <summary>A search is presented for a heavy resonance decaying into a Z boson and a Higgs (H) boson. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, recorded with the CMS experiment in the years 2016-2018. Resonance masses between 1.4 and 5 TeV are considered, resulting in large transverse momenta of the Z and H bosons. Final states that result from Z boson decays to pairs of electrons, muons, or neutrinos are considered. The H boson is reconstructed as a single large-radius jet, recoiling against the Z boson. Machine-learning flavour-tagging techniques are employed to identify decays of a Lorentz-boosted H boson into pairs of charm or bottom quarks, or into four quarks via the intermediate H $\to$ WW* and ZZ* decays. The analysis targets H boson decays that were not generally included in previous searches using the H $\to$ $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ channel. Compared with previous analyses, the sensitivity for high resonance masses is improved significantly in the channel where at most one b quark is tagged.</summary>

    <title>Magnetic Field Measurement and Analysis for the Muon g-2 Experiment</title>

    <summary>The Muon g-2 Experiment (E989) at Fermilab measures the muon magnetic anomaly, aiming to resolve the greater than 3$σ$ discrepancy between the previous measurement and the Standard Model calculation with an improved precision of 140 part-per-billion (ppb). In E989, the muon beam is stored in a ring magnet. The spin precession frequency $ω_{a}$ is measured by counting the decay positrons in 24 calorimeters, and the magnetic field is measured by nuclear magnet resonance (NMR) probes. An in-vacuum field scanning system consisting of NMR probes and read-out electronics has been implemented to measure the magnetic field applied to the muon beam. An additional 378 NMR probes, placed at fixed locations outside the vacuum chamber, monitor the field drift in between field scans. A high-accuracy probe was designed for calibrating the probes in the scanner. In this presentation, the magnetic field measurement hardware system and analysis methods will be described in detail. The progress of the Run-1 data analysis and improvements in Run-2 will be presented as well.</summary>
