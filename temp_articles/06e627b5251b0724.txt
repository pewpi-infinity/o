    <summary>  The linear Stark effect shows that the first excited state of hydrogen atom has large permanent electric dipole moment (EDM), d(H)=3eao (ao is Bohr radius). Using special capacitors our experiments discovered that the ground state K, Rb or Cs atom is polar atom with a large EDM of the order of eao as hydrogen atom of excited state. Their capacitance(C) at different voltage (V) was measured. The C-V curve shows that the saturation polarization of K, Rb or Cs vapor has be observed when the field E more than ten to the fifth power V/m. When the saturation polarization appeared, nearly all K, Rb or Cs atoms(more than 98 percent) turned toward the direction of the field, and C is approximately equal to Co (Co is vacuum capacitance) or their dielectric constant is nearly the same as vacuum! K, Rb or Cs vapor just exist in the lowest energy state, so we see the vacuum state containing a large number of atoms! Due to the saturation polarization of hydrogen vapor of excited state is easily appears, we conjecture that a vacuum state containing a large number of hydrogen atom of excited state may exist at early Universe when the absolute temperature T is approximately equal to ten to the fifth power K.</summary>

    <summary>Hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) has been proposed as one of the carbonaceous solids detected in the interstellar medium. Energetic processing of the a-C:H particles leads to the dissociation of the C-H bonds and the formation of hydrogen molecules and small hydrocarbons. Photo-produced H2 molecules in the bulk of the dust particles can diffuse out to the gas phase and contribute to the total H2 abundance. We have simulated this process in the laboratory with plasma-produced a-C:H and a-C:D analogs under astrophysically relevant conditions to investigate the dependence of the diffusion as a function of temperature. Plasma-produced a-C:H analogs were UV-irradiated using a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. Molecules diffusing to the gas-phase were detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer, providing a measurement of the outgoing H2 or D2 flux. By comparing the experimental measurements with the expected flux from a one-dimensional diffusion model, a diffusion coefficient D could be derived for experiments carried out at different temperatures. Dependance on the diffusion coefficient D with the temperature followed an Arrhenius-type equation. The activation energy for the diffusion process was estimated (ED(H2)=1660+-110 K, ED(D2)=2090+-90 K), as well as the pre-exponential factor (D0(H2)=0.0007+0.0013-0.0004 cm2 s-1, D0(D2)=0.0045+0.005-0.0023 cm2 s-1) The strong decrease of the diffusion coefficient at low dust particle temperatures exponentially increases the diffusion times in astrophysical environments. Therefore, transient dust heating by cosmic rays needs to be invoked for the release of the photo- produced H2 molecules in cold PDR regions, where destruction of the aliphatic component in hydrogenated amorphous carbons most probably takes place.</summary>

    <title>Water formation at low temperatures by surface O2 hydrogenation II: the reaction network</title>

    <summary>Water is abundantly present in the Universe. It is the main component of interstellar ice mantles and a key ingredient for life. Water in space is mainly formed through surface reactions. Three formation routes have been proposed in the past: hydrogenation of surface O, O2, and O3. In a previous paper [Ioppolo et al., Astrophys. J., 2008, 686, 1474] we discussed an unexpected non-standard zeroth-order H2O2 production behaviour in O2 hydrogenation experiments, which suggests that the proposed reaction network is not complete, and that the reaction channels are probably more interconnected than previously thought. In this paper we aim to derive the full reaction scheme for O2 surface hydrogenation and to constrain the rates of the individual reactions. This is achieved through simultaneous H-atom and O2 deposition under ultra-high vacuum conditions for astronomically relevant temperatures. Different H/O2 ratios are used to trace different stages in the hydrogenation network. The chemical changes in the forming ice are followed by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). New reaction paths are revealed as compared to previous experiments. Several reaction steps prove to be much more efficient (H + O2) or less efficient (H + OH and H2 + OH) than originally thought. These are the main conclusions of this work and the extended network concluded here will have profound implications for models that describe the formation of water in space.</summary>
