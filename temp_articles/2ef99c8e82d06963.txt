    <summary>  An approximation for the unknown two-electron wavefunctions (geminals) of the interacting uniform electron gas is found, starting from the effective screened Coulomb potential proposed by Overhauser [Can. J. Phys. 73, 683 (1995)]. The short-range part (small electron-electron distances) of the corresponding pair density is in accurate agreement with the Quantum Monte Carlo results.</summary>

    <summary>  The Bloch wavefunction leads either to mathematically impossible consequences or suggests that the ground state energy is a function of size and shape when the geometry of large crystals is considered in detail. It is incompatible with the assumption underlying the Born-von Karman periodic boundary condition. The source of the difficulty is the incorrect dependence of the Bloch wavefunction on the wavenumber index k. The mathematically impossible consequences can be overcome if the periodic part of the electron wavefunction is represented as un(r), which is dependent only on the band index, n, and is independent of the wavenumber index k. This correct form of the wavefunction is consistent with the Bloch theorem and with all other properties of Bloch wavefunctions. The correct form is also consistent with the Born-von Karman periodic boundary condition. The correct form of the electronic wavefunction in a periodic solid has profound consequences. It simplifies the calculation of electronic structure as only one wavefunction per band, un(r), needs to be evaluated. It brings about a conceptual unification between the band picture favored by physicists and the bond picture favored by chemists. The correct form of the electron wavefunction will simplify the understanding of many phenomena involving valence electrons.</summary>

    <title>New Reflections on Electron's Energy and Wavefunction in the Hydrogen Atom</title>
    <updated>2009-07-17T00:57:57Z</updated>

    <summary>  Schrodinger's equation predicts something very peculiar about the electron in the Hydrogen atom: its total energy must be equal to zero. Unfortunately, an analysis of a zero-energy wavefunction for the electron in the Hydrogen atom has not been attempted in the published literature. This paper provides such an analysis for the first time and uncovers a few interesting facts, including the fact that a "zero-energy wavefunction" is actually a quantized version of the classical wavefunction that has been known for decades.</summary>
