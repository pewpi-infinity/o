    <summary>  It is shown that the superconducting intermetallic compound MgB2 possesses a narrow, partly filled "superconducting band" with Wannier functions of special symmetry in its band structure. This result corroborates previous observations about the band structures of numerous superconductors and non-superconductors showing that evidently superconductivity is always connected with such superconducting bands. These findings are interpreted in the framework of a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model. Within this new group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow superconducting bands. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconducting band is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a conventional low-Tc or a high-Tc superconductor. This interpretation provides the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.</summary>

    <summary>Superconductivity in lanthanide- and actinide-based heavy-fermion metals can have different microscopic origins. Among others, Cooper pair formation based on fluctuations of the valence, of the quadrupole moment or of the spin of the localized 4f/5f shell have been proposed. Spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity in CeCu2Si2 was demonstrated by inelastic neutron scattering to exist in the vicinity of a spin-density-wave quantum critical point. The isostructural HF compound YbRh2Si2 which is prototypical for a Kondo-breakdown quantum critical point has so far not shown any sign of superconductivity down to approximately 10mK. In contrast, results of de-Haas-van-Alphen experiments by Shishido et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 74, 1103 (2005)) suggest superconductivity in CeRhIn5 close to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point beyond the spin-density-wave type, at which the Kondo effect breaks down. For the related compound CeCoIn5 however, a field-induced quantum critical point of spin-density-wave type is extrapolated to exist inside the superconducting phase.</summary>

    <title>Charge expulsion, Spin Meissner effect, and charge inhomogeneity in superconductors</title>

    <summary>  Superconductivity occurs in systems that have a lot of negative charge: the highly negatively charged $(CuO2)^{--}$ planes in the cuprates, negatively charged $(FeAs)^-$ planes in the iron arsenides, and negatively charged $B^-$ planes in magnesium diboride. And, in the nearly filled (with negative electrons) bands of almost all superconductors, as evidenced by their positive Hall coefficient in the normal state. According to the theory of hole superconductivity, metals become superconducting because they are driven to expel negative charge (electrons) from their interior. This is why NIS tunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased samples. It is also why there is a Meissner effect: as electrons are expelled towards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force imparts them with azimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner current that screens the interior magnetic field. In type II superconductors, the Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach the surface gives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents. In the absence of applied magnetic field, expelled electrons still acquire azimuthal velocity, due to the spin-orbit interaction, in opposite direction for spin-up and spin-down electrons: the "Spin Meissner effect". This results in a macroscopic spin current flowing near the surface of superconductors in the absence of applied fields. In strongly type II superconductors this physics should give rise to charge inhomogeneity and spin currents throughout the interior of the superconductor, to large sensitivity to (non-magnetic) disorder and to a strong tendency to phase separation.</summary>
