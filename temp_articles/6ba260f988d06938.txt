    <summary>The detection, removal and reduction of hydrogen peroxide is of significant importance for its increasing application in the areas of environment, food, electrochemistry and clinical laboratory. Herein the dissociative adsorption behavior of hydrogen peroxide on ultrathin magnesia (001) films deposited on transition metal is uncovered for the first time by employing periodic density-functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. The hydrogen peroxide is dissociated smoothly and reduced to surface hydroxyls on MgO(001)/TM, and the dissociative adsorption energies of all the considered fragmentation configurations are substantially negative, demonstrating dissociation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide on MgO(001)/TM is thermodynamically favorable. The dissociative adsorption energy decreases monotonously with increasing film thickness, demonstrating the lower reactivity of thick oxide films. Moreover, we examined the suitability of several transition metal slabs (molybdenum, silver, vanadium, tungsten and gold) combined with magnesia for splitting hydrogen peroxide. The dissociative adsorption energies enhance when the lattice constants of substrate slabs increase, indicating the chemisorption strength can be tuned by category of metal slabs as well as thickness of oxide film. The mechanism of reactivity enhancement for energetically and dynamically favorable decomposition of hydrogen peroxide on supported magnesia is elucidated by characterizing the geometric structures and electronic properties. The fragmentation and reduction of diethyl peroxide and peroxyacetone are also studied to reveal the catalytic activity of ultrathin magnesia toward splitting organic peroxides. The results are wished to provide useful clue for detecting and reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides by employing oxide-metal hybrid nanostructure.</summary>

    <summary>Bismuth (III) oxide (Bi2O3) has been highly studied as a photocatalyst for green hydrogen production due to its low band gap, yet its efficiency requires enhancement. This study synthesizes a defective and strained black Bi2O3 by severe straining under high pressure, via a high-pressure torsion method, to improve its photocatalytic hydrogen production. The material rich in oxygen vacancies exhibits a ten-fold improvement in water splitting with excellent cycling stability. Such improvement is due to improved light absorption, narrowing band gap and reduced irradiative electron-hole recombination. Moreover, the valence band bottom energy positively increases by straining leading to a high overpotential for hydrogen production. This research highlights the potential of vacancies and lattice strain in developing dopant-free active catalysts for water splitting.</summary>

    <title>Excited configurations of hydrogen in the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ perovskite lattice associated with hydrogen exchange and transport</title>

    <summary>Excited configurations of hydrogen in the oxyhydride BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ ($x=0.1-0.5$), which are considered to be involved in its hydrogen transport and exchange processes, were investigated by positive muon spin relaxation ($μ^+$SR) spectroscopy using muonium (Mu) as a pseudoisotope of hydrogen. Muons implanted into the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ perovskite lattice were mainly found in two qualitatively different metastable states. One was assigned to a highly mobile interstitial protonic state, which is commonly observed in perovskite oxides. The other was found to form an entangled two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system with the nuclear spin of an H$^-$ ion at the anion site. The structure of the (H,Mu) complex agrees well with that of a neutralized center containing two H$^-$ ions at a doubly charged oxygen vacancy, which was predicted to form in the SrTiO$_{3-δ}$ perovskite lattice by a computational study [Y. Iwazaki $et$ $al$., APL Materials 2, 012103 (2014)]. Above 100 K, interstitial Mu$^+$ diffusion and retrapping to a deep defect were observed, which could be a rate-limiting step of macroscopic Mu/H transport in the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ lattice.</summary>
