    <summary>By strongly driving a transmon-resonator system, the transmon qubit may eventually escape from its cosine-shaped potential. This process is called transmon ionization (TI) and known to be detrimental to the qubit coherence and operation. In this work, we investigate the onset of TI in an irreversible, parametrically-driven, frequency conversion process in a system consisting of a superconducting 3D-cavity coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon qubit. Above a critical pump power we find a sudden increase in the transmon population. Using Renyi entropy, Floquet modes, and Husimi Q functions, we infer that this abrupt change can be attributed to a quantum-to-classical phase transition. Furthermore, in the context of the single-photon detection, we measure a TI-uncorrected detection efficiency of up to 86% and estimate a TI-corrected value of up to 78% by exploiting the irreversible frequency conversion. Our numerical simulations suggest that increasing the detuning between the pump and qubit frequencies and increasing the qubit anharmonicity can suppress the TI impact. Our findings highlight the general importance of the TI process when operating coupled qubit-cavity systems.</summary>

    <title>Information, complexity, and quantum entanglement on doubly excited states of helium atom</title>

    <summary>The electronic density ρ(r) in atoms, molecules and solids is, in general, a distribution that can be observed experimentally, containing spatial information projected from the total wave function. These density distributions can be though as probability distributions subject to the scrutiny of the analytical methods of information theory, namely, entropy measures, quantifiers for the complexity, or entanglement measures. Although the classification of resonant doubly excited states of He-like atoms in terms of labels of approximate quantum numbers have not been exempt from controversies, a well known proposal follows after the works by Herrick and Sinanoglu and Lin, with a labeling based on K, T, and A numbers for the Rydberg series of increasing n2 and for a given ionization He+ (N = n1). In this work we intend to justify this kind of classification from the topological analysis of the one-particle ρ(r) and two-particle \r{ho}(r1,r2) density distributions of the localized part of the resonances (computed with a Feshbach projection formalism and configuration interaction wave functions in terms of B-splines bases), using global quantifiers (Shannon) as well as local ones (Fisher information). We also studied measures for the entanglement using the von Neumann and linear entropies computed from the reduced one-particle density matrix within our correlated configuration interaction approach. We find in this study that global measures like the Shannon entropy hardly distinguishes among resonances in the whole Rydberg series. On the contrary, measures like the Fisher information, von Neumann and linear entropies are able to qualitatively discriminate the resonances, grouping them according to their (K, T)A labels.</summary>

    <title>Derivation of Reference Distribution Functions for Tokamak-plasmas by Statistical Thermodynamics</title>

    <summary>A general approach for deriving the expression of reference distribution functions by statistical thermodynamics is illustrated, and applied to the case of a magnetically confined plasma. The local equilibrium is defined by imposing the minimum entropy production, which applies only to the linear regime near a stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state and the maximum entropy principle under the scale invariance restrictions. This procedure may be adopted for a system subject to an arbitrary number of thermodynamic forces, however, for concreteness, we analyze, afterwords, a magnetically confined plasma subject to three thermodynamic forces, and three energy sources: i) the total Ohmic heat, supplied by the transformer coil, ii) the energy supplied by Neutral Beam Injection (NBI), and iii) the RF energy supplied by Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ICRH) system which heats the minority population. In this limit case, we show that the derived expression of the distribution function is more general than that one, which is currently used for fitting the numerical steady-state solutions obtained by simulating the plasma by gyro-kinetic codes. An application to a simple model of fully ionized plasmas submitted to an external source is discussed. Through kinetic theory, we fixed the values of the free parameters linking them with the external power supplies. The singularity at low energy in the proposed distribution function is related to the intermittency in the turbulent plasma.</summary>
