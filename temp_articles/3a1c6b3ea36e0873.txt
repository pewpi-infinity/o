    <summary>We first consider the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox for the system of two particles with spin 1/2 with entangled spins in first-quantized quantum mechanics (QM). If measurement is governed by wavefunction collapse, then gedanken experiments show that a number of fundamental principles including conservation of angular momentum and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be violated. We conclude that the collapse of the spin part of the wavefunction cannot happen and therefore an EPR paradox does not arise for this system. QM unitarity alone is sufficient to rule out "spooky" action at a distance. The absence of spin wavefunction collapse leads to several interesting conclusions about how measurement works in QM: When wavefunction collapse does not happen, (i) a signal from a macroscopic measuring device indicating that a system is in a state S does not necessarily mean that it is or was in S and (ii) the uncertainty in QM at the microscopic level is transmitted to uncertainty in signals for the macroscopic measuring device. We derive two general results on how quantum measurement works and illustrate them in a spin-1/2 measurement. In contrast to first-quantized QM, in quantum field theory we are unable to fully rule out the possibility of wavefunction collapse. However, when we insist on unitarity (thereby excluding the possibility of wavefunction collapse) and additionally take into account in the wavefunction all degrees of freedom involved in the measurement (including those of the equipment, experimentalists, etc.), a consistant acceptable understanding of the Bell-inequality-type experiments involving entangled photon polarizations emerges including the absence of an EPR paradox. The ability of an experimentalist to be aware of his perceptions but unable to be conscious of other components of a generalized Schrodinger Cat plays a role in resolving the Measurement Problem.</summary>

    <arxiv:comment>The previous version had misconceptions about the existence of non-linear effects in quantum electrodynamics. The latest version contains additional results concerning wavefunction collapse in quantum field theory, and it is shown that the Measurement Problem is not an issue in unitary quantum field theory</arxiv:comment>

    <summary>When most people think of physics, they think of what they learned in high school physics: that the world is fundamentally predictable. Given the position and velocity of a particle in space, it should be possible to predict its position at any moment in the future, right? Though this was thought to be true for thousands of years, recent developments in the field of physics have shown that this isn't actually true. Instead of being fundamentally predictable, the universe is fundamentally unpredictable. However, this doesn't seem to make sense. What happened to the centuries of physics developed by Newton, Bernoulli, and Lagrange? Well, as it turns out, they weren't actually wrong. Their equations were actually an approximation of a formula called the wavefunction, which is the "Newton's Laws" equivalent for modern physics. In this paper, we'll take a look at this peculiar wavefunction and why our intuition about the world is completely wrong.</summary>

    <title>Quantum states as complex probabilities: The physics behind direct observations of photon wavefunctions in weak measurements</title>

    <summary>Weak measurements of photon position can be used to obtain direct experimental evidence of the wavefunction of a photon between generation and ultimate detection. Significantly, these measurement results can also be understood as complex valued conditional probabilities of intermediate photon positions. It is therefore possible to interpret the quantum state as a complex valued probability distribution from which measurement probabilities can be derived according to Bayesian rules. The conventional measurement probabilities derived from squares of the wavefunction then describes the effects of measurement back-action, which originate from a non-classical relation between dynamics and statistics that is characteristic of quantum mechanics. It is pointed out that this relation can be used to derive the complete Hilbert space formalism directly from complex probabilities, without the axiomatic introduction of quantum states or operators.</summary>
