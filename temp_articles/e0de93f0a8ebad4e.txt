    <summary>We investigate nanoscale local anodic oxidation (LAO) on hydrogen-intercalated graphene grown by controlled sublimation of silicon carbide (SiC). Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was used as a lithographic and characterization tool in order to investigate the local properties of the nanofabricated structures. The anomalous thickness observed after the graphene oxidation process is linked to the impact of LAO on the substrate. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed to demonstrate the presence of two oxidation regimes depending on the applied bias. We show that partial and total etching of monolayer graphene can be achieved by tuning the bias voltage during LAO. Finally, a complete compositional characterization was achieved by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).</summary>

    <title>Contrary Effect of B and N Doping into Graphene and Graphene Oxide Heterostructures with MoS$_2$ on Interface Function and Hydrogen Evolution</title>

    <summary>Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) attracts attention as a high efficient and low cost photocatalyst for hydrogen production, but suffers from low conductance and high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers. In this work, we investigate the MoS$_2$ heterostructures with graphene variants (GVs), including graphene, graphene oxide, and their boron- and nitrogen-doped variants, by using first-principles calculations. Systematic comparison between graphene and graphene oxide composites is performed, and contrary effect of B and N doping on interface function and hydrogen evolution is clarified. We find that upon the formation of the interfaces some amount of electronic charge transfers from the GV side to the MoS$_2$ layer, inducing the creation of interface dipole and the reduction of work function, which is more pronounced in the graphene oxide composites. Moreover, our results reveal that N doping enhances the interface functions by forming donor-type interface states, whereas B doping reduces those functions by forming acceptor-type interface states. However, the B-doped systems exhibit lower Gibbs free energy difference for hydrogen adsorption on GV side than the N-doped systems, which deserves much consideration in the design of new functional photocatalysts.</summary>

    <summary>  Graphene - a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagonal lattice - has one of the strongest possible atomic bonds and can be viewed as a robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups. Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and, essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains the hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties.</summary>
