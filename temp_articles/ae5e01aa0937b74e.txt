    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>

    <summary>In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</summary>
