    <summary>Based on first principles density functional theory calculations we explore the energetics of the conversion of carbon mono and dioxide to methane over graphene oxide surfaces. Similar to the recently discovered hydration of various organic species over this catalyst, the transfer of hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl groups of graphene oxide provide a step by step transformation hydrogenation of carbon oxides. Estimated yields of modeled reactions at room temperature are about 0.01% for the carbon mono and dioxide. For the modeling of graphene oxide/metal oxide composites, calculations in the presence of MO_2 (where M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe) have been performed. Results of these calculations demonstrate significant decreases of the energy costs and increases of reaction yields to 0.07%, which is comparable to the efficiency of these reactions over platinum and ruthenium-based photocatalysts. Increasing the temperature to the value 100C should provide the total conversion of carbon mono and dioxides.</summary>

    <summary>  Experimental and theoretical results on chemical functionalization of graphene are reviewed. Using hydrogenated graphene as a model system, general principles of the chemical functionalization are formulated and discussed. It is shown that, as a rule, 100% coverage of graphene by complex functional groups (in contrast with hydrogen and fluorine) is unreachable. A possible destruction of graphene nanoribbons by fluorine is considered. The functionalization of infinite graphene and graphene nanoribbons by oxygen and by hydrofluoric acid is simulated step by step.</summary>

    <title>Potential reversible hydrogen storage in Li-decorated carbon allotrope PAI-Graphene: A first-principles study</title>

    <summary>Two-dimensional porous carbon nanomaterials are proven to be promising hydrogen storage substrates as they possess high surface area, large number of active sites, low molecular mass, and hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed on both sides of these materials. By performing first-principles density functional theory-based calculations, we report ultrahigh reversible hydrogen uptake in lithium decorated 2D carbon allotrope PAI-graphene, which is formed of a regular pattern of polymerized as-indacenes (PAI). We found that a single unit cell of PAI-graphene can be decorated by 8 Li atoms, in which each Li atom can reversibly adsorb 4 hydrogen molecules, leading to 15.7 % of H uptake, remarkably higher than the DOE demand of 6.5 %. Li atom donates its valence 2s-electron to PAI-graphene and gets ionized. The adsorption energies of the various H2 attached to Li-atom are found to be suitable for reversible use during practical applications. Hydrogen molecules get attached to the ionized metal atom by electrostatic interactions. An energy barrier of 1.48 eV is present for the diffusion of Li atoms between the two most stable adsorption sites which justifies the absence of the clustering of Li atoms.</summary>
