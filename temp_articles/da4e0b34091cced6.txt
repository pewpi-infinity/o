    <summary>We consider Majorana fermions (MFs) in quasi-one-dimensional nanowire systems containing normal and superconducting sections where the topological phase based on Rashba spin orbit interaction can be tuned by magnetic fields. We derive explicit analytic solutions of the MF wavefunction in the weak and strong spin orbit interaction regimes. We find that the wavefunction for one single MF is a composite object formed by superpositions of different MF wavefunctions which have nearly disjoint supports in momentum space. These contributions are coming from the extrema of the spectrum, one centered around zero momentum and the other around the two Fermi points. As a result, the various MF wavefunctions have different localization lengths in real space and interference among them leads to pronounced oscillations of the MF probability density. For a transparent normal-superconducting junction we find that in the topological phase the MF leaks out from the superconducting into the normal section of the wire and is delocalized over the entire normal section, in agreement with recent numerical results by Chevallier et al. (arXiv:1203.2643).</summary>

    <title>Rogue wavefunctions due to noisy quantum tunneling potentials</title>

    <summary>In this paper we study the effects of white-noised potentials on nonlinear quantum tunneling. We use a split-step scheme to numerically solve the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with a tunneling potential. We consider three different types of potentials, namely; the single rectangular barrier, double rectangular barrier and triangular barrier. For all these three cases we show that white-noise given to potentials do not trigger modulation instability for tunneling of the sech type soliton solutions of the NLSE. However white-noised potentials trigger modulation instability for tunneling of the sinusoidal wavefunctions, thus such a wavefield turns into a chaotic one with many apparent peaks. We argue that peaks of such a field may be in the form of rational rogue wave solutions of the NLSE. Our results can be used to examine the effects of noise on quantum tunneling. Since a rogue wavefunction means a higher probability of the tunneling particle to be at a given (x,t) coordinate, our results may also be used for developing the quantum science and technology with many possible applications including but are not limited to increasing the resolution and efficiency of scanning tunneling microscopes, enhancing proton tunneling for DNA mutation and enhancing superconducting properties of junctions.</summary>

    <title>Theory of superconductivity of gravitation and the dark matter enigma</title>

    <summary>In this article, the question of the nature of cold dark matter is approached from a new angle. By invoking the Cauchy problem of relativity it is shown how, under very precise astrophysical conditions, the Einstein general theory of relativity is formally equivalent to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. This fact lead us to suspect that the superconductivity of gravitation ought to be a real physical process occurring in the outskirts of galaxies. It is found that quantum mechanically gravity can achieve a type-II superconductor state characterised by the Gizburg-Landau parameter $κ=1.5$, and it is suggested that a probability flux of Cooper pairs (quantum gravitational geons charged with vacuum energy) are directly responsible for the flatness exhibited by the rotation curves in spiral galaxies, as well as the exotic behaviour observed in galactic cluster collisions. If this hypothesis proves correct, the whole phenomenon of dark matter may count, after all, as another triumph for Einstein's theory of gravity. The tension between gravitation and quantum mechanics is explored further by a subtle consideration of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of the York-time action, providing additional motivation for the above line of reasoning. In particular, Penrose's estimate for the rate of collapse of the wavefunction is recovered, and connected to the instability of Misner space.</summary>
