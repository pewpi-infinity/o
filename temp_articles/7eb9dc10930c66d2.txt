    <title>Classical and quantum flux energy conditions for quantum vacuum states</title>

    <summary>The classical energy conditions are known to not be fundamental physics -- they are typically violated by semiclassical quantum effects. Consequently, some effort has gone into finding possible semiclassical replacements for the classical energy conditions -- the most well developed being the Ford-Roman quantum inequalities. In the current article we shall instead develop classical and quantum versions of a "flux energy condition" (FEC and QFEC) based on the notion of constraining the possible fluxes measured by timelike observers. The naive classical FEC will be seen to be satisfied in some situations, and even for some quantum vacuum states, while its quantum analogue (the QFEC) is satisfied (for naturally defined quantum vacuum states) under a rather wide range of conditions. The situation for completely general (nonvacuum) quantum states is less clear.</summary>

    <title>Atom-Field Interaction: From Vacuum Fluctuations to Quantum Radiation and Quantum Dissipation / Radiation Reaction</title>

    <summary>In this paper we dwell on three issues: 1) revisit the relation between vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in atom-field interactions, which began in the 70s and settled in the 90s with its resolution recorded in monographs; 2) the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) of the system, pointing out the differences between that in linear response theory (LRT) assuming ultra-weak coupling between the system and the bath, and the FDR in an equilibrated final state, relaxed from the nonequilibrium evolution of an open quantum system; 3) quantum radiation from an atom interacting with a quantum field: Begin with vacuum fluctuations in the field acting on the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of an atom, adding to its dynamics a stochastic component which engenders quantum radiation whose backreaction causes quantum dissipation in the idf of the atom. For a stationary atom, we show how the absence of radiation results from complex cancellations, at a faraway observation point, of the interference between emitted radiation from the atom and the local fluctuations in the free field. We point out that the entity which enters into the duality relation with vacuum fluctuations is not classical radiation reaction, but quantum dissipation. Finally, regarding Issue 2, for systems with many atoms, the existence of a set of correlation-propagation relations shows how the correlations between the atoms are related to the propagation of their mutual influence manifesting in the quantum field. The CPR is absolutely crucial in keeping the balance of energy flows between the constituents of the system, and between the system and its environment. Without the consideration of this additional relation in tether with the FDR, dynamical self-consistency cannot be sustained. Combination of these two sets of relations capture the physical essence of the interaction between an atom and a quantum field.</summary>

    <summary>  Three related topics on the quantum-vacuum geometric phases in a noncoplanarly curved optical fiber is presented: (i) a brief review: the investigation of vacuum effect and its experimental realization; (ii) the sequence of ideas of geometric phases in the fiber; (iii) three derivations of effective Hamiltonian that describes the wave propagation of photon field in a curved fiber.</summary>
