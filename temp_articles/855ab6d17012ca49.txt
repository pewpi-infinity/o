    <summary>A numerical and dimensional correlation supported by reported literature experimental evidence (Homes, Harshmann along with Voyager, EGRET, FERMI, WMAP, Planck and other space platforms) is presented which indicates that superconductivity is congruent with Charge Conjugation, Parity Change and TimeReversal (CPT) theorem and scalable with Friedmann Lemaire Robertson Walker (FLRW) cosmology within the concept of Schwinger pair production, Maxwell's permittivity-permeability and the de Broglie hypothesis. This momentum and energy conserving (elastic) CPT resonant structural lattice reverses phase and group velocities at the nuclear dimension as dictated by the speed of light and is scalable over 15 ours of magnitude from nuclear to universe dimensions, from the universe Big Bang event to present and is consistent with nuclear (quark) weak and strong forces, electromagnetic and gravitational forces being mediated by a particle of constant mass (110.123 x electron mass or 56.3 MeV/c2) related to the Higgs mass. This isotropic homogeneous CPT structure filling the space vacuum presently defines an extremely cold dark energy condition (&lt;&lt;CMBR) that dictates an equally extremely cold baryonic dark matter. The model predicts a deceleration value consistent with flat galactic rotation curves and with observed Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space translation and rotational deceleration and is generally consistent with the notion that: An object moving through momentum space will decelerate. This deceleration concept allows Type 1A supernovae universe expansion data to be interpreted as if the local universe is slowing down with respect to the rest. The predicted 33.8 microHz universe oscillations are observed by The LISA Pathfinder and stellar core gravity waves. The entire concept focuses towards engineering a critical optical volume energy (COVE) as a possible energy source.</summary>
