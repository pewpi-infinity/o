    <summary>Hybridization is a very fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon, with the text book example of binding two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule. In semiconductor physics, a quantum dot (QD) can be considered as an artificial atom, with two coupled QDs forming a molecular state, and two electrons on a single QD the equivalent of a helium atom. Here we report tunnel spectroscopy experiments illustrating the hybridization of another type of discrete quantum states, namely of superconducting subgap states that form in segments of a semiconducting nanowire in contact with superconducting reservoirs. We show and explain a collection of intermediate states found in the process of merging individual bound states, hybridizing with a central QD and eventually coherently linking the reservoirs. These results may serve as a guide in future Majorana fusion experiments and explain a large variety of recent bound state experiments.</summary>

    <title>Optimization of Tritium Breeding Ratio in a DT and DD Submersion Tokamak Fusion Reactor</title>

    <summary>The mass of stars is enough to confine a plasma to fuse light atoms, but this is not possible to engineer on Earth. Fortunately, nuclear engineering can rely on the magnetic confinement of a plasma using superconducting coils so long as the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) is optimized. This paper will investigate some of the materials which can increase the rate at which Tritium is produced within the breeding blanket layer of Submersion Tokamak reactors, a design that uses magnetic confinement of a plasma in the shape of a torus to execute nuclear fusion. Using the Paramak Python module to model several geometries and OpenMC to run a simulation, it can be observed how neutron multipliers, enrichment, and the neutron energy spectrum affect TBR. This experiment will mainly observe different material choices that have been considered and their TBR based on their cross sections, dose rate, thermal properties and safety. By altering the neutron energy spectrum to account for DD and DT plasma, the difference in these compounds' Tritium breeding efficacy is noted. Neutron energy spectra are an important factor in optimising the TBR levels as the neutrons generated by the fusion reactions in the plasma interact with the breeder material in the blanket and produce tritium through the reaction with Lithium. Since Tritium is a rare isotope of hydrogen that is used as fuel in fusion reactions and has a short half-life, it is essential to produce tritium within the fusion reactor itself. Without the tritium breeding capability, it would not be feasible to generate energy via fusion. A TBR greater than unity indicates that the reactor can generate more tritium than it consumes, ensuring self-sufficiency in the tritium inventory. Since Tritium is the most reliable and efficient fuel for these reactors, optimising the TBR is of paramount importance in the long road to commercialization of nuclear fusion.</summary>

    <title>Using magnetic levitation to produce cryogenic targets for inertial fusion energy: experiment and theory</title>

    <summary>We present experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic levitation of hydrogen gas bubble surrounded by liquid hydrogen confined in a semi-transparent spherical shell of 3 mm internal diameter. Such shells are used as targets for the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), for which a homogeneous (within a few percent) layer of a hydrogen isotope should be deposited on the internal walls of the shells. The gravity does not allow the hydrogen layer thickness to be homogeneous. To compensate this gravity effect, we have used a non-homogeneous magnetic field created by a 10 T superconductive solenoid. Our experiments show that the magnetic levitation homogenizes the thickness of liquid hydrogen layer. However, the variation of the layer thickness is very difficult to measure experimentally. Our theoretical model allows the exact shape of the layer to be predicted. The model takes into account the surface tension, gravity, van der Waals, and magnetic forces. The numerical calculation shows that the homogeneity of the layer thickness is satisfactory for the ICF purposes.</summary>
