    <summary>  In the analytic-Bargmann representation associated with the harmonic oscillator and spin coherent states, the wavefunction as entire complex functions can be factorized in terms of their zeros in a unique way. The Schrödinger equation of motion for the wavefunction is turned to a system of equations for its zeros. The motion of these zeros as a non-linear flow of points is studied and interpreted for linear and non-linear bosonic and spin Hamiltonians. Attention is given to the study of the zeros of the Jaynes-Cummings model and to its finite analoque. Numerical solutions are derived and discussed.</summary>

    <title>Two-orbital Schwinger Boson Representation of Spin-One: Application to a Non-abelian Spin Liquid with Quaternion Gauge Field</title>

    <summary>A non-abelian spin liquid in triangular lattice spin-1 systems was recently formulated in the form of continuum field theory [T. Grover, and T. Senthil, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 077203 (2011); Cenke Xu, A.W.W. Ludwig, arXiv:1012.5671]. It has spin-1/2 bosonic spinons coupled to emergent quaternion gauge fields, and can be obtained by quantum disordering a non-collinear spin nematic order hypothesized to describe NiGa_2S_4 [H. Tsunetsugu, and M. Arikawa, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 75, 083701 (2006)], However a microscopic lattice description, e.g. the lattice spinon (mean-field) Hamiltonian and the spin wavefunction, has been missing, and it has been noted that the standard Schwinger boson or bosonic triplon representations of spin-1 cannot describe this spin liquid. In this paper a two-orbital Schwinger boson representation for spin-1 systems is developed and used to construct a mean-field description of this quaternion spin liquid. Projecting the mean-field state produces a prototype wavefunction, which is a superposition of close-packed AKLT loop configurations with nontrivial amplitudes. This new formalism and related wavefunctions may be generalized to higher spin systems and can possibly produce spin liquid states with even richer emergent gauge structures.</summary>

    <title>Ground state, quasi-hole, a pair of quasihole wavefunctions and instability in bilayer quantum Hall systems</title>
    <updated>2006-10-25T02:16:40Z</updated>

    <summary>  Bilayer quantum Hall system (BLQH) differ from its single layer counterparts (SLQH) by its symmetry breaking ground state and associated neutral gapless mode in the pseudo-spin sector. Due to the gapless mode, qualitatively good groundstate and low energy excited state wavefunctions at any finite distance is still unknown. We investigate this important open problem by the Composite Boson (CB) theory developed by one of the authors to study BLQH systematically. We derive the ground state, quasi-hole and a pair of quasihole wavefunctions from the CB theory and its dual action. We find that the ground state wavefunction differs from the well known $ (111) $ wavefunction at any finite $ d $. In addition to commonly known multiplicative factors, the quasi-hole and a pair of quasi-holes wavefunctions also contain non-trivial normalization factors multiplying the correct ground state wavefunction. All the distance dependencies in all the wavefunctions are encoded in the spin part of the ground state wavefunction. The instability encoded in the spin part of the groundstate wavefunction leads to the pseudo-spin density wave formation proposed by one of the authors previously. Some subtleties related to the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) projection of the wavefunctions are briefly discussed.</summary>
