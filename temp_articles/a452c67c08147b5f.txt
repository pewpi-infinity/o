    <summary>  We demonstrate that at the usual 1E-7 torr range of base pressures in the sputtering chamber, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the existence of a thin AlOx layer at the Nb/Al interface in both Nb/Al-AlOx/Pb tunnel junctions and Nb/Al bilayers. This is due to the time elapsed between the deposition of the Nb and Al bottom layers, even at times as short as 100 s. We also give some direct evidence of the oxidation of the top Pb electrode on the Nb electrode surface. Such oxidation probably occurs at the pinholes of the intermediate Al-AlOx layer of the junctions, as a consequence of the oxidation state at the Nb/Al interface. We therefore suggest that both the base pressure and the time lapse between layer depositions should be carefully controlled in magnetic tunnel junctions.</summary>

    <summary>Effects of graphene oxide nanomaterials addition and oxidation level on ignition delay and burning rate of ethanol droplets are experimentally investigated. Three graphene oxide samples are synthesized and characterized. Separate high-speed OH* chemiluminescence and high-speed shadowgraphy images are collected. The results suggest that increasing the loading concentration from 0 to 0.1% generally increases the ignition delay, except for ethanol doped with the highly oxidized graphene. The probability density function of the atomized baby droplet diameter, initial projected velocity, and length of the projected trajectory are similar for all tested conditions and independent of the oxidation level and loading concentration of the additives. The joint probability density function calculated for the atomization-related parameters against one another suggests that the majority of the baby droplets feature a relatively short lifetime, indicating they may potentially burn inside the flame envelope. Using droplet surface regression curves versus time, the burning rate for periods in which the atomization does not occur, and for the periods that the atomization is present are estimated. The former burning rate is shown to enhance by increasing the loading concentration and reducing the oxidation level of graphene. However, it is found that a maximum increase in the latter burning rate for both loading concentrations occurs for ethanol doped with the graphene oxide that features maximum amount of infrared radiation absorption. It is shown that relatively intense atomization suppresses the mass loss. Doping ethanol with graphene oxide and increasing the loading concentration from 0.01 to 0.1% enhances the overall burning rate, with a maximum enhancement of 8.4% pertaining to addition of reduced oxidized graphene oxide and for the loading concentration of 0.1%.</summary>

    <title>Alpha-tocopherol inhibits pore formation in the oxidized bilayers</title>

    <summary>In biological membranes, alpha-tocopherols (α-toc; vitamin E) protect polyunsaturated lipids from free radicals. Although the interactions of α-toc with non-oxidized lipid bilayers have been studied, their on oxidized bilayers remain unknown. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oxidized lipid bilayers were performed with varying concentrations of α-toc. Bilayers with 1-palmitoyl-2-lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC) lipids and its aldehyde derivatives at 1:1 ratio were studied. Our simulations show that oxidized lipids self-assemble into aggregates with a water pore rapidly developing across the lipid bilayer. The free energy of transporting an α-toc molecule in a lipid bilayer suggests that α-tocs can passively adsorb into the bilayer. When α-toc molecules were present at low concentrations in bilayers containing oxidized lipids, the formation of water pores was slowed down. At high α-toc concentra-tions, no pores were observed. Based on the simulations, we propose that the mechanism of how α-toc inhibits pore formation in bilayers with oxidized lipids is the follow-ing: α-tocs trap the polar groups of the oxidized lipids at the membrane-water interface resulting in a decreased probability for the oxidized lipids to reach contact with the two leaflets and initiate pore formation. This demon-strates that α-toc molecules not only protect the bilayer from oxidation but also help to stabilize the bilayer after lipid peroxidation occurs. These results will help in de-signing more efficient molecules to protect membranes from oxidative stress.</summary>
