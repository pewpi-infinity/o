    <summary>A novel interpretation is given of Dirac's "wave equation for the relativistic electron" as a quantum-mechanical one-particle equation. In this interpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different "topological spin" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct particles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the existence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particular the ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximal analytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr-Newman spacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, "zero-gravity" means the limit $G\to 0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel interpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be capable of describing both the electron and the positron in "external" fields in many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a single position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were a two-particle equation! A Dirac equation is formulated for a ring-like bi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere in the topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ring bi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-Broglie-Bohm type law extracted from the Dirac equation. As an application, the pertinent general-relativistic zero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr-Newman magnetic moment be identified with the so-called "anomalous magnetic moment of the physical electron," not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is only a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.</summary>

    <title>On the Existence of Additional (Hydrino) states in the Dirac equation</title>

    <summary>In case of spinless particles there appear additional (singular) solutions in the framework of relativistic Klein-Gordon equation for Coulomb potential. These solutions obey to all requirements of quantum mechanical general principles. Observation of such states (hydrino, small hydrogen) should be important for manifestation of various physical phenomena. In this article the same problem is considered for spin-1/2 particle (electron) in the Dirac equation. It is shown that such kind of solutions really occurs, but the rate of singularity is more higher than in spinless case. By this reason we have no time- independence of total probability (norm). Moreover the orthogonality property is also failed, while the total probability is finite in the certain area of the model-parameters. Therefore, we are inclined to conclude that this additional solution in the Dirac equation must be ignored and restrict ourselves only by normal (standard) solutions.</summary>

    <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>

    <summary>We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $ω_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $ω_c\lesssim Δ$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $ω_c\gtrsim \ Δ$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</summary>
