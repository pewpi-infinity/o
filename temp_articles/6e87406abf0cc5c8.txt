    <summary>The superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) recently attract considerable attention due to their exciting properties, such as the robustness of superconductivity against atomic disorder and extremely high-pressure. The well-studied crystal structure of superconducting HEAs is body-centered-cubic (bcc) containing Nb, Ti, and Zr atoms. The same elements are contained in Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, which is a recently discovered bcc HEA and shows a gum-metal-like behavior after cold rolling. The gum metal is also an interesting system, exhibiting superelasticity and low Young's modulus. If gum metals show superconductivity and can be used as a superconducting wire, the gum-metal HEA superconductors might be the next-generation superconducting wire materials. Aiming at a fundamental assessment of as-cast Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr multicomponent alloys including Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, we have investigated the structural and superconducting properties of the alloys. All alloys investigated show the superconductivity, and the valence electron concentration dependence of the superconducting critical temperature is very close to those of typical superconducting bcc HEAs.</summary>

    <title>Coexistence of Superconductivity and ferromagnetism in high entropy carbide ceramics</title>

    <summary>Generally, the superconductivity was expected to be absent in magnetic systems, but this reception was disturbed by unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, iron-based superconductors and recently discovered nickelate, since their superconductivity is proposed to be related to the electron-electron interaction mediated by the spin fluctuation. However, the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is still rare in conventional superconductors. In this work, we reported the coexistence of these two quantum orderings in high entropy carbide ceramics (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9, (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, and they are expected to be conventional superconductors. Clear magnetic hysteresis loop was observed in these high entropy carbides, indicating a ferromagnetic ground state. A sharp superconducting transition is observed in (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9 with a Tc of 3.4 K and upper critical field of ~3.35 T. Meanwhile, superconductivity is suppressed to some extent and zero-resistance state disappears in (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, in which stronger magnetism is presented. The upper critical field of (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C is only ~1.5 T, though they show higher transition temperature near 5.7 K. The ferromagnetism stems from the carbon vacancies which occurs often during the high temperature synthesis process. This work not just demonstrate the observation of superconductivity in high entropy carbide ceramics, but also provide alternative exotic platform to study the correlation between superconductivity and magnetism, and is of great benefit for the design of multifunctional electronic devices.</summary>

    <title>Specific heat of unconventional superconductivity in NaxCoO2-yH2O</title>

    <summary>  Comprehensive studies of the low-temperature specific heat C(T,H) in NaxCoO2-yH2O are presented. At H=0, a very sharp anomaly was observed at T=4.7 K indicating the existence of bulk superconductivity. There exists the T^2 term in C(T,H=0) in the superconducting state manifesting the line nodal superconducting order parameter. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 26.6 % based on the consideration of entropy conservation at Tc for the second-order superconducting phase transition. An abrupt change of the slope in Tc(H) was observed. Possible scenarios such as the multiple phase transitions in the mixed state are discussed.</summary>
