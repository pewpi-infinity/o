    <summary>The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory aims to demonstrate $\approx$ 10% ionization cooling of a muon beam by its interaction with low-Z absorber materials followed by restoration of longitudinal momentum in RF linacs. MICE Step IV, including the first LH2 or LiH absorber cell sandwiched between two particle tracking spectrometers, is the collaboration's near-term goal. Two large superconducting spectrometer solenoids and one focus coil solenoid will provide a magnetic field of $\approx$4 T in the tracker and absorber-cell volumes. The status of these components is described, as well as progress towards Steps V and VI, including the eight RF cavities to provide the required 8 MV/m gradient in a strong magnetic field; this entails an RF drive system to deliver 2 MW, 1 ms pulses of 201 MHz frequency at 1 Hz repetition rate, the distribution network to deliver 1 MW to each cavity with correct RF phasing, diagnostics to determine the gradient and the muon transit phase, and development of the large-diameter magnets required for the linacs.</summary>

    <summary>  Direct detection of WIMP dark matter candidates has to face many difficult challenges. In particular, it requires an extremely high level of background rejection. The only way out seems to be particle identification which, for experiments based on nucleus recoil, is most efficiently performed by simultaneously detecting ionization or light and phonons. When comparing different approaches, it is necessary to keep in mind the potential requirement of building large detectors and the difficulties that this condition may raise for some cryogenic devices. It is claimed that the luminescent bolometer (simultaneous detection of light and phonons) red by arrays of superconducting tunnel junctions, as proposed by the author some years ago, ultimately provides the most appropriate WIMP detector. Solar neutrino detection and other applications are also briefly discussed.</summary>

    <summary>A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$, transfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus. The energy lost by electron is more than the energy gained by the nucleus. The resulting energy goes in exciting the atom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon, mercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber experiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper, we study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering experiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth, why muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like lead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the elastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron microscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these phenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give Bloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give resistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and superconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in Fermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures. Electron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions. We turn our attention to electron-proton scattering both eleastic and inelastic, as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and understand the independence of ineleastic cross-section of with respect to transferred momentum. We see, why we can just say that there are three quarks in proton from elastic cross-section. Our main contribution in this article is we are detailed at places, we find literature terse.</summary>
