    <summary>Hydrogen adsorption on graphene in commensurate periodic arrangements leads to bandgap opening at the Dirac point and the emergence of dispersionless midgap bands. We study these bandgap effects and their dependence on periodicity for a single hydrogen adsorbate on periodic graphene supercells using spin-polarized density-functional theory calculations. Our results show that for certain periodicities, marked by a scale factor of three, the bandgap is suppressed to a great extent, and has a special level structure around the neutrality point. We present explanations for the origin of the changes to the band structure in terms of the \textit{ab initio} Hamiltonian matrix. This method may be used to obtain a more accurate tight-binding description of single hydrogen adsorption on graphene.</summary>

    <summary>Nontrivial topology of Dirac (DSMs), Weyl (WSMs) and nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) are delineated by the novel band crossings near the Fermi level in the bulk and the appearance of exotic surface states. Among them, nodal line semimetals have gained immense interest due to the formation of one-dimensional nodal ring near the Fermi level. Using density funtional theory (DFT) calculations, we report that two dimensional (2D) NLSM phase can be hosted on hydrogen passivated (010) surface of gallium (gallenene) and on other group 13 elements, without inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). NLSM in these 2D systems is protected by the presence of crystalline (CS) along with inversion (IS) and the time reversal symmetry (TRS). In the presence of SOC, aluminane preserved its topological NLSM phase while in other single layered group 13 elements, a gap opened at the nodal point due to relatively stronger SOC effect. On applying tensile strain along with the inclusion of SOC, hydrogen passivated gallenene (gallenane) evolves into quantum spin Hall insulator with an indirect bandgap of 28 meV. The appearance of long range dissipationless linearly dispersive helical edge states and a large gap in gallenane make it promising for room temperature spintronics applications.</summary>

    <title>First-principles investigation of Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$: unveiling their potential for hydrogen storage through mechanical and optoelectronic properties</title>

    <summary>This study uses the density functional theory (DFT) approach with GGA-PBE to assess the effect of substituting alkali metals in Rb$_{2}$CaH and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ on their hydrogen storage potential. To address the challenges associated with predicting accurate electronic properties in materials containing heavier elements such as cesium, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects have been incorporated into our calculations. The mechanical robustness of both Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$, as demonstrated by their mechanical properties, highlights these materials as promising candidates due to their stability in hydrogen storage applications. Anisotropic factors show that all materials exhibit anisotropy, suggesting a directional dependency in their properties. The Pugh ratio indicates that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are brittle materials. Based on the calculated band gap, the electronic band structure analysis, conducted using both HSE06 and GGA-PBE, shows that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are wide-bandgap materials. Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ exhibit the highest optical conductivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss function among optoelectronic materials, emphasizing their superior absorption and electron transfer capabilities. The hydrogen storage capacity has been evaluated for practical applications; Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ show the highest gravimetric and volumetric capacities.</summary>
