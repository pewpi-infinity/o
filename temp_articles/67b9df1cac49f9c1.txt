    <summary>In this paper we present experimental data of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation obtained in a high purity crystalline sample of cooper hydrogenated by gaseous charge. The sample is oriented in the &lt;111&gt; crystallographic direction and aged for this work in three stages between 64 and 97 days. The results indicate that the hydrogen is mainly segregated at the dislocation core, inhibiting the Hydrogen Snoek-Köster relaxations verified at earlier aging stages. Despite of this, a contribution to viscosity in the kink-chain resonance is provided by the mobile hydrogen in the dislocations core by its side movement along the dislocation line. At temperatures at which the hydrogen begins to freeze in the lattice the geometrical kinks find a gradual increase on the hindering of their movements along dislocation lines, becoming immobile when the hydrogen is completely frozen in the crystal, anchoring the dislocations in short loops. Although the viscosity associated with the mobile hydrogen is removed, the resonance associated with geometrical kinks is not completely cancelled. The interaction hydrogen-dislocation can be fully described in terms of kinks in dislocations.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen Diffusion and Trapping in α-Iron: The Role of Quantum and Anharmonic Fluctuations</title>

    <summary>We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic α-iron, taking account of the quantum fluctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.</summary>

    <title>Topological features of hydrogenated graphene</title>

    <summary>Hydrogen adatoms are one of the most the promising proposals for the functionalization of graphene. Hydrogen induces narrow resonances near the Dirac energy, which lead to the formation of magnetic moments. Furthermore, they also create local lattice distortions which enhance the spin-orbit coupling. The combination of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling allows for a rich variety of phases, some of which have non trivial topological features. We analyze the interplay between magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in ordered arrays of hydrogen on graphene monolayers, and classify the different phases that may arise. We extend our model to consider arrays of adsorbates in graphene-like crystals with stronger intrinsic spin-orbit couplings.</summary>
