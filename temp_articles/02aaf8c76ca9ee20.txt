    <summary>Superconductivity, the lossless flow of electric current, occurs typically at very low temperatures. A possible exception is highly pressurized hydrogen, for which room temperature superconductivity has been predicted. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur in highly pressurized hydrogen. Here we avoid those approximations and exploit the ``jellium'' model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity involves the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We confirm that metallic hydrogen should indeed exhibit superconductivity, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We also find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range significantly exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</summary>

    <summary>Metallic hydrogen, existing in remarkably extreme environments, was predicted to exhibit long-sought room-temperature superconductivity. Although the superconductivity of metallic hydrogen has not been confirmed experimentally, superconductivity of hydrogen in hydrides was recently discovered with remarkably high critical temperature as theoretically predicted. In recent years, theoretical simulations have become a new paradigm for material science, especially exploration of material at extreme pressure. As the typical high-pressure material, metallic hydrogen has been providing a fertile playground for advanced simulations for long time. Simulations not only provide the substitute of experiments for hydrogen at high-pressure, but also encouraged the discovery of almost all the experimentally discovered superconducting hydrides with the record high superconducting transition temperature. This work reviews recent progress in hydrogen and hydrides under extreme pressure, focusing on phase diagram, structures and the long-sought goal of high-temperature superconductivity. In the end, we highlight structural features of hydrides for realization of hydrogen-driven superconducting hydrides near ambient pressure.</summary>

    <title>Enhancing superconductivity in MXenes through hydrogenation</title>

    <summary>Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are an emerging class of atomically-thin superconductors, whose characteristics are highly prone to tailoring by surface functionalization. Here we explore the use of hydrogen adatoms to enhance phonon-mediated superconductivity in MXenes, based on first-principles calculations combined with Eliashberg theory. We first demonstrate the stability of three different structural models of hydrogenated Mo- and W-based MXenes. Particularly high critical temperatures of over 30 K are obtained for hydrogenated Mo$_2$N and W$_2$N. Several mechanisms responsible for the enhanced electron-phonon coupling are uncovered, namely (i) hydrogen-induced changes in the phonon spectrum of the host MXene, (ii) emerging hydrogen-based phonon modes, and (iii) charge transfer from hydrogen to the MXene layer, boosting the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we demonstrate that hydrogen adatoms are moreover able to induce superconductivity in MXenes that are not superconducting in pristine form, such as Nb$_2$C.</summary>
