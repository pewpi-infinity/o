    <summary>  The linear Stark effect shows that the first excited state of hydrogen atom has large permanent electric dipole moment (EDM), d(H)=3eao (ao is Bohr radius). Using special capacitors our experiments discovered that the ground state K, Rb or Cs atom is polar atom with a large EDM of the order of eao as hydrogen atom of excited state. Their capacitance(C) at different voltage (V) was measured. The C-V curve shows that the saturation polarization of K, Rb or Cs vapor has be observed when the field E more than ten to the fifth power V/m. When the saturation polarization appeared, nearly all K, Rb or Cs atoms(more than 98 percent) turned toward the direction of the field, and C is approximately equal to Co (Co is vacuum capacitance) or their dielectric constant is nearly the same as vacuum! K, Rb or Cs vapor just exist in the lowest energy state, so we see the vacuum state containing a large number of atoms! Due to the saturation polarization of hydrogen vapor of excited state is easily appears, we conjecture that a vacuum state containing a large number of hydrogen atom of excited state may exist at early Universe when the absolute temperature T is approximately equal to ten to the fifth power K.</summary>

    <summary>  Recent experiments show that the islanding behavior during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of Si on Si(111) using disilane (Si${_2}$H${_6}$) is quite different from that due to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). While the latter can be understood using rate equation theories (RET), the islanding exponent (connecting the power law growth of island density with growth rate) obtained for the CVD growth is a puzzle, with the CVD exponent being almost twice the MBE exponent. We carry out (2+1) dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo(MC) simulations to study this CVD growth. Hydrogen plays a critical role during growth. Disilane breaks up into hydrides on the Si surface. We use MC simulations to explore a number of cases involving one or two migrating species and show that the large islanding exponent is probably due to the presence of two hydrides, one of which has a much shorter lifetime than the other. We modify RET taking this possibility into account in order to shed light on the experimental observation. We calculate the scaling properties of the island distributions using MC simulations and the modified RET, and conclude that the large effective CVD exponents arise from the failure of the simple island number scaling scenario which no longer applies to the two-component situation prevailing under CVD growth conditions.</summary>

    <title>Water transport in protoplanetary disks and the hydrogen isotopic composition of chondrites</title>

    <summary>The D/H ratios of carbonaceous chondrites, believed to reflect that of water in the inner early solar system, are intermediate between the protosolar value and that of most comets. The isotopic composition of cometary water has been accounted for by several models where the isotopic composition of water vapor evolved by isotopic exchange with hydrogen gas in the protoplanetary disk. However, the position and the wide variations of the distribution of D/H ratios in carbonaceous chondrites have yet to be explained. In this paper, we assume that the D/H composition of cometary ice was achieved in the disk building phase and model the further isotopic evolution of water in the inner disk in the classical T Tauri stage. Reaction kinetics compel isotopic exchange between water and hydrogen gas to stop at $\sim$500 K, but equilibrated water can be transported to the snow line (and beyond) via turbulent diffusion and consequently mix with isotopically comet-like water. Under certain simplifying assumptions, we calculate analytically this mixing and the resulting probability distribution function of the D/H ratio of ice accreted in planetesimals and compare it with observational data. The distribution essentially depends on two parameters: the radial Schmidt number Sc$_R$, which ratios the efficiencies of angular momentum transport and turbulent diffusion, and the range of heliocentric distances of accretion sampled by chondrites. The minimum D/H ratio of the distribution corresponds to the composition of water condensed at the snow line, which is primarily set by Sc$_R$. Observations constrain the latter to low values (0.1-0.3), which suggests that turbulence in the planet-forming region was hydrodynamical in nature, as would be expected in a dead zone. Such efficient outward diffusion would also account for the presence of high-temperature minerals in comets.</summary>
