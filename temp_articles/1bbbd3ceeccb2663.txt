    <summary>Freely falling point-like objects converge toward the center of the Earth. Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the superconducting system.
  A "Cavendish-like" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational perturbations are present.</summary>

    <summary>We explore electronic and structural properties of Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu-H-N structures with specific N,H ordering as plausible candidates for near-ambient superconductivity possibly originating from their remarkably narrow hydrogen-based bands at the Fermi level. Although LuH$_{2.875}$N$_{0.125}$ exhibits an instability persisting up to 17 GPa, it is anharmonically stable near ambient pressure when accounting for quantum nuclear effects. The presence of flat bands near $E_\text{F}$ is understood to arise from destructive\ quantum interference between N-p and surrounding H-s orbitals, with certain types of defects leaving the flat bands unaffected. The results suggest there is an optimal pressure near ambient where the superconducting $T_{\text{c}}$ is maximized in this structure by anharmonically-stabilized low-frequency and non-adiabatically coupled high-frequency hydrogen modes. Despite the metastability of this structure, its electronic properties and dynamical stability when calculated beyond a classical harmonic approach can explain the reported near-ambient superconductivity in Lu-H-N.</summary>

    <title>Bipolaronic high-temperature superconductivity</title>

    <summary>Electron-lattice interactions play a prominent role in quantum materials, making a deeper understanding of direct routes to phonon-mediated high-transition-temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) superconductivity desirable. However, it has been known for decades that weak electron-phonon coupling gives rise to low values of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, while strong electron-phonon coupling leads to lattice instability or formation of bipolarons, generally assumed to be detrimental to superconductivity. Thus, the route to high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ materials from phonon-mediated mechanisms has heretofore appeared to be limited to raising the phonon frequency as in the hydrogen sulfides. Here we present a simple model for phonon-mediated high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductivity based on superfluidity of light bipolarons. In contrast to the widely studied Holstein model where lattice distortions modulate the electron's potential energy, we investigate the situation where lattice distortions modulate the electron hopping. This physics gives rise to small-size, yet light bipolarons, which we study using an exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo approach, demonstrating a new route to phonon-mediated high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. We find that $T_\mathrm{c}$ in our model generically and significantly exceeds typical upper bounds based on Migdal-Eliashberg theory or superfluidity of Holstein bipolarons. The key ingredient in this bipolaronic mechanism that gives rise to high $T_\mathrm{c}$ is the combination of light mass and small size of bipolarons. Our work establishes principles towards the design of high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors via functional material engineering.</summary>
