    <summary>Hydrogen at high temperature and pressure undergoes a phase transition from a liquid molecular phase to a conductive atomic state, or liquid metallic hydrogen, sometimes referred to as the plasma phase transition (PPT). The PPT phase line was observed in a recent experiment studying laser-pulse heated hydrogen in a diamond anvil cell in the pressure range $\sim 100 - 170 \text{GPa}$ for temperatures up to $\sim 2000 \text{K}$. The experimental signatures of the transition are (i) a negative pressure-temperature slope, (ii) a plateau in the heating curve, assumed to be related to the latent heat of transformation, and (iii) an abrupt increase in the reflectance of the sample. We present a finite element simulation that accurately takes into account the position and time dependence of the heat deposited by the laser pulse. We calculate the heating curves and the sample reflectance and transmittance. This simulation confirms that the observed plateaus are related to the phase transition, however we find that large values of latent heat are needed and may indicate that dynamics at the transition are more complex than considered in current models. Finally, experiments are proposed that can distinguish between a change in optical properties due to a transition to a metallic state or due to closure of the bandgap in molecular hydrogen.</summary>

    <title>An optically enhanced crystalline silicon allotrope: hydrogen passivated type II silicon clathrate</title>

    <summary>While Si clathrates have been explored as promising direct bandgap semiconductors, their practical optoelectronic performance has been limited by high doping levels and structural defects. Hydrogen has long been used to improve the optoelectronic quality of conventional Si, yet its role in clathrate structures remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that hydrogen (deuterium) can be incorporated into type II Si clathrate framework using remote plasma treatment. This process leads to the formation of NaD and SiD complexes, which significantly reduce both the Na donor density and dangling bond defects. Electron paramagnetic resonance confirms nearly a tenfold decrease in Na-related donor states, resulting in the lowest doping level reported in Si clathrates to date. Following passivation, the integrated photoluminescence intensity increases by a factor of 40, accompanied by a blue shift of the main emission peak, consistent with a transition closer to the intrinsic band edge. A new emission peak at 930 nm, attributed to hydrogen-related recombination centers, also appears. These improvements remain stable up to 400 oC. Altogether, this work establishes hydrogen passivation as a viable strategy for enhancing light emission in Si clathrates and opens a new pathway toward their application in Si-based light-emitting diodes and other direct-bandgap optoelectronic devices.</summary>

    <title>Comment on A First-order Phase Transition to Metallic Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>A recent paper by Zaghoo et al. presents optical data at high-pressure and high-temperature and interprets the data as evidence for a first-order phase transition to metallic hydrogen during heating. Here we argue that the presented data are contradictory with these claims. Elucidating this issue is important for building a coherent picture that is emerging as the results of theoretical calculations of various levels and experimental investigations employing static and dynamic compression techniques. In this context, the use of adequate probes of the electronic and chemical state is crucial. Optical probes that do not address the energy dependent conductivity while making multiple references to the Drude model are highly speculative. Indeed, the available dynamic and static compression data and theoretical modeling show that study of energy dependent conductivity is important for understanding the nature of hot dense hydrogen. Moreover, the most recent investigations suggest that the critical point, which demarcates the regimes of crossover between insulating and plasma state at low densities to the first order liquid-liquid transition, is above 200 GPa. Below we concentrate on inconsistencies in the interpretation of data in Zaghoo et al, which call for careful examination of their claims and further detailed investigations. We analyze their optical data and use finite element calculations and argue that the high-temperature state studied in Zaghoo et al. is not metallic and that the data cannot discriminate between a first-order phase transition and a continuous phase transition, or even a bandgap drop within one phase</summary>
