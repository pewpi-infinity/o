    <summary>Proton-conducting oxides are potential materials for electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, hydrogen pumps, hydrogen sensors, and the tritium purification and recovery system in nuclear fusion reactors. The hydrogen concentration in oxide materials is important, but its precise measurement is difficult. In this study, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) was used to investigate hydrogen dissolution and release behavior in proton-conducting oxides, yttrium (Y), and cobalt (Co) doped barium-zirconates in the temperature range of 673-1273 K using deuterium (D2) and heavy water (D2O). Specimens were prepared with conventional powder metallurgy: the powder of three zirconates, BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-a (BZY), BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O3-a (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) was pressed into discs and fired in the air at 1873 K for 20 h. The densities of the sintered BZY, BZYC, and CZI specimens were 98 percent, 99.7 percent, and 99.5 percent of the theoretical densities respectively. XRD, SEM, and EDX were performed for the structural and morphological analysis of the sintered samples. From TDS measurement, a similar trend of temperature-dependent hydrogen solubility was obtained for all samples compared to the tritium imaging plate (TIP) methods literature data of HT- and DTO-exposed samples. To compare the experimental results of the deuterium desorption profile derived by TDS analysis, the simulation code of the tritium migration analysis program, version 4 (TMAP4) was employed.</summary>

    <summary>Proton-conducting oxides have potential applications in hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, and other electrochemical devices including the tritium purification and recovery systems of nuclear fusion reactors. Although the distribution of hydrogen (H) in such oxide materials is an important aspect, its precise measurement is difficult. In the present study, the hydrogen solubility and diffusivity behavior of BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY), BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) were studied using tritiated heavy water vapor i.e., DTO (~2 kPa, tritium (T) = 0.1%) by converting the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) values of the imaging plate (IP). The samples were exposed to DTO vapor at 673 K for 2 h or at 873 K for 1 h. The disc-shaped oxide specimens (diameter ~7.5 mm; thickness ~2.3 mm; theoretical density (TD) &gt; 98 %) were prepared by conventional powder metallurgy. The IP images of the specimen surfaces of all the three materials T-exposed revealed that BZY showed the most uniform T distribution with the highest tritium activity. The cross-sectional T concentration profiles of the cut specimens showed that T diffused deeper into BZY and BZYC than into CZI. The hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in the CZI specimen were lower than that in the BZY and BZYC specimens. This suggested that barium zirconates were more favorable proton conductors than calcium zirconates.</summary>

    <title>Raman microscopy as a defect microprobe for hydrogen bonding characterization in materials used in fusion applications</title>

    <summary>We present the Raman microscopy ability to detect and characterize the way hydrogen is bonded with elements that will be used for ITER's plasma facing components. For this purpose we first use hydrogenated amorphous carbon samples, formed subsequently to plasma-wall interactions (hydrogen implantation, erosion, deposition...) occurring inside tokamaks, to demonstrate how this technique can be used to retrieve useful information. We pay attention in identifying which spectroscopic parameters are sensitive to the local structure (sp 3 /sp 2) and which gives information on the hydrogen content using isothermal and linear temperature ramp studies on reference samples produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. We then focus on the possibility to use this fast, non-destructive and non-contact technique to characterize the influence of hydrogen isotope implantation in few nanometers of graphite and beryllium as C is still used in the JT-60 tokamak and Be is used in JET and will be used as plasma-facing component in the future reactor ITER. We also pay attention on implantation in tungsten oxide which may be formed accidently in the machine.</summary>
