    <summary>In this work, we designed and experimentally verified a highly integrated broadband entropy source for a quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on vacuum fluctuations. The core of the entropy source is a hybrid laser-and-silicon-photonics chip, which is only 6.3 $ \times $ 2.6 $ \times $ 1.5 mm$^{3}$ in size. A balanced homodyne detector based on cascaded radio-frequency amplifiers in the entropy source achieves a 3 dB bandwidth of 2.4 GHz and a common-mode rejection ratio above 25 dB. The quantum-to-classical-noise ratio is 9.51 dB at a photoelectron current of 1 mA. The noise equivalent power and equivalent transimpedance are 8.85$\,\text{pW}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ , and 22.8 k$Ω$, respectively. After optimization using equalizer technology that eliminates the dependence of adjacent samples, the quantum random number generation rate reaches 67.9 Gbps under average conditional minimum entropy and 61.9 Gbps under the worst-case conditional minimum entropy. The developed hybrid chip enhances the integrability and speed of QRNG entropy sources based on vacuum fluctuations.</summary>

    <title>Vacuum Landscaping: Cause of Nonlocal Influences without Signaling</title>

    <summary>In the quest for an understanding of nonlocality with respect to an appropriate ontology, we propose a "cosmological solution". We assume that from the beginning of the universe each point in space has been the location of a scalar field representing a zero-point vacuum energy that nonlocally vibrates at a vast range of different frequencies across the whole universe. A quantum, then, is a nonequilibrium steady state in the form of a "bouncer" coupled resonantly to one of those (particle type dependent) frequencies, in remote analogy to the bouncing oil drops on an oscillating oil bath as in Couder's experiments. A major difference to the latter analogy is given by the nonlocal nature of the vacuum oscillations.
  We show with the examples of double- and $n$-slit interference that the assumed nonlocality of the distribution functions alone suffices to derive the de Broglie-Bohm guiding equation for $N$ particles with otherwise purely classical means. In our model, no influences from configuration space are required, as everything can be described in 3-space. Importantly, the setting up of an experimental arrangement limits and shapes the forward and osmotic contributions and is described as vacuum landscaping.</summary>

    <title>Adiabatic amplification of the harmonic oscillator energy when the frequency passes through zero</title>

    <summary>We study the evolution of the energy of a harmonic oscillator when its frequency slowly varies with time and passes through zero value. We consider both the classical and quantum descriptions of the system. We show that after a single frequency passage through zero value, the famous adiabatic invariant ratio of energy to frequency (which does not hold for zero frequency) is reestablished again, but with the proportionality coefficient dependent on the initial state. The dependence on the initial state disappears after averaging over phases of initial states with the same energy (in particular, for the initial vacuum, Fock and thermal quantum states). In this case, the mean proportionality coefficient is always greater than unity. The concrete value of the mean proportionality coefficient depends on the power index of the frequency dependence on time near zero point. In particular, the mean energy triplicates if the frequency tends to zero linearly. If the frequency attains zero more than once, the adiabatic proportionality coefficient strongly depends on lengths of time intervals between zero points, so that the mean energy behavior turns out quasi-stochastic after many passages through zero value. The original Born-Fock theorem does not work after the frequency passes through zero. However, its generalization is found: the initial Fock state becomes a wide superposition of many Fock states, whose weights do not depend on time in the new adiabatic regime. When the mean energy triplicates, the initial Nth Fock state becomes a superposition of, roughly speaking, 6N states, distributed non-uniformly. The initial vacuum and low-order Fock states become squeezed, as well as initial thermal states with low values of the mean energy.</summary>
