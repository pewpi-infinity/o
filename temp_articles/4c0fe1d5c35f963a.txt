    <summary>We present the observation of a complete bandgap and collective spin wave excitation in two-dimensional magnonic crystals comprised of arrays of nanoscale antidots and nanodots, respectively. Considering that the frequencies dealt with here fall in the microwave band, these findings can be used for the development of suitable magnonic metamaterials and spin wave based signal processing. We also present the application of a numerical procedure, to compute the dispersion relations of spin waves for any high symmetry direction in the first Brillouin zone. The results obtained from this procedure has been reproduced and verified by the well established plane wave method for an antidot lattice, when magnetization dynamics at antidot boundaries is pinned. The micromagnetic simulation based method can also be used to obtain iso--frequency countours of spin waves. Iso--frequency contours are analougous of the Fermi surfaces and hence, they have the potential to radicalize our understanding of spin wave dynamics. The physical origin of bands, partial and full magnonic bandgaps has been explained by plotting the spatial distribution of spin wave energy spectral density. Although, unfettered by rigid assumptions and approximations, which afflict most analytical methods used in the study of spin wave dynamics, micromagnetic simulations tend to be computationally demanding. Thus, the observation of collective spin wave excitation in the case of nanodot arrays, which can obviate the need to perform simulations may also prove to be valuable.</summary>

    <title>Indirect to direct bandgap transition in methylammonium lead halide perovskite</title>

    <summary>Methylammonium lead iodide perovskites are considered direct bandgap semiconductors. Here we show that in fact they present a weakly indirect bandgap 60 meV below the direct bandgap transition. This is a consequence of spin-orbit coupling resulting in Rashba-splitting of the conduction band. The indirect nature of the bandgap explains the apparent contradiction of strong absorption and long charge carrier lifetime. Under hydrostatic pressure from ambient to 325 MPa, Rashba splitting is reduced due to a pressure induced ordering of the crystal structure. The nature of the bandgap becomes increasingly more direct, resulting in five times faster charge carrier recombination, and a doubling of the radiative efficiency. At hydrostatic pressures above 325 MPa, MAPI undergoes a reversible phase transition resulting in a purely direct bandgap semiconductor. The pressure-induced changes suggest epitaxial and synthetic routes to higher efficiency optoelectronic devices.</summary>

    <title>Donor Spin Qubits in Ge-based Phononic Crystals</title>

    <summary>We propose qubits based on shallow donor electron spins in germanium. Spin-orbit interaction for donor spins in germanium is in many orders of magnitude stronger than in silicon. In a uniform bulk material it leads to very short spin lifetimes. However the lifetime increases dramatically when the donor is placed into a quasi-2D phononic crystal and the energy of the Zeeman splitting is tuned to lie within a phonon bandgap. In this situation single phonon processes are suppressed by energy conservation. The remaining two-phonon decay channel is very slow. The Zeeman splitting within the gap can be fine tuned to induce a strong, long-range coupling between the spins of remote donors via exchange by virtual phonons. This, in turn, opens a very efficient way to manipulate the quits. We explore various geometries of phononic crystals in order to maximize the coherent qubit-qubit coupling while keeping the decay rate minimal. We find that phononic crystals with unit cell sizes of 100-150 nm are viable candidates for quantum computing applications and suggest several spin-resonance experiments to verify our theoretical predictions.</summary>
