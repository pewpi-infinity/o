    <summary>Vanadium ions charge states and their incorporation in the yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12 (YAG) lattice were studied by the correlated optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. In as-grown crystals, the occupation of the V3+ at both the octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum sites was proven. The V3+ to V4+ charge transformation was observed after annealing in air, whereas annealing in the hydrogen atmosphere resulted exclusively in a slight weakening of the V3+ absorption bands due to partial recharge of these ions. Spin Hamiltonian parameters of the V3+ and V4+ ions at the tetrahedral sites including the zero field splitting and the 51V hyperfine constants have been determined using the high-frequency, up to 300 GHz, EPR measurements. From the analysis of the spin Hamiltonian parameters in the framework of the crystal field theory, the ground state energy levels splitting of the V3+ and V4+ ions were calculated. The charge distribution over the tetrahedral V3+ and its nearest oxygen surroundings was found to be strongly inhomogeneous whereas the tetrahedral V4+ ion concentrated the charge with very weak participation of surrounding ligands. Furthermore, the correlation of the optical and EPR data allowed the proper assignment of the optical absorption peaks in YAG:V crystals.</summary>

    <title>Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ Nanotubes with Optimized Spintronic Functionalities Prepared by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>

    <summary>Permalloy Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ is one of the key magnetic materials in the field of magnonics. Its potential would be further unveiled if it could be deposited in three dimensional (3D) architectures of sizes down to the nanometer. Atomic Layer Deposition, ALD, is the technique of choice for covering arbitrary shapes with homogeneous thin films. Early successes with ferromagnetic materials include nickel and cobalt. Still, challenges in depositing ferromagnetic alloys reside in the synthesis via decomposing the consituent elements at the same temperature and homogeneously. We report plasma-enhanced ALD to prepare permalloy Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin films and nanotubes using nickelocene and iron(III) tert-butoxide as metal precursors, water as the oxidant agent and an in-cycle plasma enhanced reduction step with hydrogen. We have optimized the ALD cycle in terms of Ni:Fe atomic ratio and functional properties. We obtained a Gilbert damping of 0.013, a resistivity of 28 $μΩ$cm and an anisotropic magnetoresistance effect of 5.6 $\%$ in the planar thin film geometry. We demonstrate that the process also works for covering GaAs nanowires, resulting in permalloy nanotubes with high aspect ratios and diameters of about 150 nm. Individual nanotubes were investigated in terms of crystal phase, composition and spin-dynamic response by microfocused Brillouin Light Scattering. Our results enable NiFe-based 3D spintronics and magnonic devices in curved and complex topology operated in the GHz frequency regime.</summary>
