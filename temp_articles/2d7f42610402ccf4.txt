    <summary>We report transport and magnetization measurements on graphitic materials that have been hydrogenated after being treated with octane. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity shows anomalies manifested as re-entrant insulator-metal transitions. Below 50 K, the magnetoresistance data shows both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic behavior as the magnetic field is decrease or increased, respectively. The system is possibly an unconventional magnetic superconductor. The irreversible behavior observed in the field-cooled vs. the zero-field cooled data for a sufficiently high magnetic field suggests that the system might enter a superconducting state below 50 K. Energy gap data is obtained from nonlocal electric differential conductance measurements. An exciton-based mechanism is likely driving the system to the superconducting state below 50 K, where the gap is divergent. We find that the hydrogenated carbon fiber is a multiple gap system with critical temperatures estimates above room temperature. The temperature dependence of the superconducting gap follows the flat-band energy relationship, with the flat band gap parameter linearly increasing with the temperature above 50 K. Thus, we find that either a magnetic or an electric field can drive this hydrogenated graphitic system to superconducting state below 50 K. In addition, AF spin fluctuations creates pseudo-gap states above 50 K.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen Doping Induced $p_x\pm ip_y$ Triplet Superconductivity in Quasi-One-Dimensional K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$</title>

    <summary>Quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Cr-based pnictide K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ has aroused great research interest due to its possible triplet superconducting pairing symmetry. Recent experiments have shown that incorporating hydrogen atoms into K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ would significantly change its electronic and magnetic properties. Hence, it's necessary to investigate the impact of hydrogen doping in superconducting pairing symmetry of this material. Employing the hydrogen as an non-trivial electron-doping, our calculates show that, different from the $p_z$-wave obtained without hydrogen, the system exhibits $p_x\pm ip_y$ pairing superconductivity under specific hydrogen doping. Specifically, we adopt the random-phase-approximation approach based on a six-band tight-binding model equipped with multi-orbital Hubbard interactions to study the hydrogen-doping dependence of the pairing symmetry and superconducting $T_c$. Under the rigid-band approximation, our pairing phase diagram shows the spin-triplet pairing states is dominated through out the hydrogen-doping regime $x\in (0,0.7)$. Particularly, the $T_c\sim x$ curve shows a peak at the 3D-quasi-1D Lifshitz transition point, and the pairing symmetry around this doping level is $p_x\pm ip_y$. The physical origin of this pairing symmetry is that the density of states is mainly concentrated at $k_x(k_y)$ with large momentum. Due to the three-dimensional character of the real material, this $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave superconducting state possesses point gap nodes. We further provide experiment prediction to identify this triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave superconductivity.</summary>

    <title>Ab initio investigation on structural stability and phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D-hydrogenated M2X (M= Mo, V, Zr; X=C, N) MXene monolayer</title>

    <summary>We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M = Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H) generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2), corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a candidate for Dirac physics.</summary>
