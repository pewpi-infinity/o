    <summary>  Extra Ordinary (X) mode conversion to Bernstein wave near Upper Hybrid Resonance (UHR) layer plays an important role in plasma heating through cyclotron resonance. Wave generation at UHR and parametric decay at high power has been observed during Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) heating experiments in toroidal magnetic fusion devices. A small linear system with ECR and UHR layer within the system has been used to conduct experiments on X-B conversion and parametric decay process as a function of system parameters. Direct probing {\em in situ} is conducted and plasma heating is evidenced by soft x-ray emission measurement. Experiments are performed with hydrogen plasma produced with 160-800 W microwave power at 2.45 GHz of operating frequency at $10^{-3}$ mbar pressure. The axial magnetic field required for ECR is such that the resonant surface (B = 875 G) is situated at the geometrical axis of the plasma system. Experimental results will be presented in the paper.</summary>

    <summary>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma measurements based on simple optical emission spectroscopy on a new compact low current ion source designed and built by the authors is presented. By observing the plasma luminescence both directly and through a low-cost transmission diffraction grating, basic characterization of the Hydrogen plasma obtainable in the ion source is carried out. Through simple processing of CCD captures of these images, optimal values for the ion source relevant operation parameters, including RF power and frequency, and Hydrogen mass flow are easily obtained. Despite the simplicity of the method and its limited accuracy as compared to the use of a full standard optical spectrometric set-up, it is shown that the presented approach can cope with basic plasma diagnostic tasks as far as the successful operation of the ion source is concerned.</summary>

    <title>Electron cyclotron resonance discharge as a source for hydrogen and deuterium ions production</title>

    <summary>  In this report, we describe characteristics of a ring-structure hydrogen plasma heated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions and confined in a mirror magnetic trap and discuss the relative efficiency of secondary electrons and thermoelectrons in negative hydrogen and deuterium ion production. The obtained data and calculations of the balance equations for possible reactions demonstrate that the negative ion production is realized in two stages. First, the hydrogen and deuterium molecules are excited in collisions with the plasma electrons to high-laying Rydberg or vibrational levels in the plasma volume. The second stage leads to the negative ion production through the process of dissociative attachment of low energy electrons. The low energy electrons are originated due to a bombardment of the plasma electrode by ions of one of the driven rings and thermoemission from heated tungsten filaments. Experiments seem to indicate that the negative ion generation occurs predominantly in the limited volume filled with thermoelectrons. Estimation of the negative ion generation rate shows that the main channel of and ion production involves the process of high Rydberg state excitation.</summary>
