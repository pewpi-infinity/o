    <summary>Wave-particle interaction (WPI) is one of the most fundamental processes in plasma physics in which one most prominent example is the Landau damping. Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.</summary>

    <title>A critique of recent semi-classical spin-half quantum plasma theories</title>

    <summary>Certain recent semi-classical theories of spin-half quantum plasmas are examined with regard to their internal consistency, physical applicability and relevance to fusion, astrophysical and condensed matter plasmas. It is shown that the derivations and some of the results obtained in these theories are internally inconsistent and contradict well-established principles of quantum and statistical mechanics, especially in their treatment of fermions and spin. Claims of large semi-classical effects of spin magnetic moments that could dominate the plasma dynamics are found to be invalid both for single-particles and collectively. Larmor moments dominate at high temperature while spin moments cancel due to Pauli blocking at low temperatures. Explicit numerical estimates from a variety of plasmas are provided to demonstrate that spin effects are indeed much smaller than many neglected classical effects. The analysis presented suggests that the aforementioned `Spin Quantum Hydrodynamic' theories are not relevant to conventional laboratory or astrophysical plasmas.</summary>

    <title>Surface plasmon oscillations in a semi-bounded semiconductor plasma</title>

    <summary>We study the dispersion properties of surface plasmon oscillations in a semi-bounded semiconductor plasma with the effects of the Coulomb exchange force associated with the spin polarization of electrons and holes as well as the effects of the Fermi degenerate pressure and the quantum Bohm potential. Starting from a quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model coupled to the Poisson equation, we derive the general dispersion relation for surface plasma waves. Previous results in this context are recovered. The dispersion properties of the surface waves are analyzed in some particular cases of interest and the relative influence of the quantum forces on these waves are also studied for a nano-sized GaAs semiconductor plasma. It is found that the Coulomb exchange effects significantly modify the behaviors of the surface plasmon waves. The present results are applicable to understand the propagation characteristics of surface waves in solid density plasmas.</summary>
