    <summary>Within the subgap of amorphous oxide semiconductors like amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) are donor-like and acceptor-like states that control the operational physics of optically transparent thin-film transistors (TFTs). Hydrogen incorporation into the channel layer of a top-gate a-IGZO TFT exists as an electron donor that causes an observed negative shift in the drain current-gate voltage ($\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$) transfer curve turn-on voltage. Normally, hydrogen is thought to create shallow electronic states just below the conduction band mobility edge, with the donor ionization state controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics involving the position of the Fermi level with respect to the donor ionization energy. However, hydrogen does not behave as a normal donor as revealed by the subgap density of states (DoS) measured by the photoconduction response of top-gate a-IGZO TFTs to within 0.3 eV of the CBM edge. Specifically, the DoS shows a subgap peak above the valence band mobility edge growing at the same rate that $\mathrm{I_{D} - V_{G}}$ transfer curve measurements suggest that hydrogen was incorporated into the channel layer. Such hydrogen donor behavior in a-IGZO is anomalous and can be understood as follows: Non-bonded hydrogen ionization precedes its incorporation into the a-IGZO network as a bonded species. Ionized hydrogen bonds to a charged oxygen-on-an-oxygen-site anion, resulting in the formation of a defect complex denoted herein as, $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$. Formation of an $\mathrm{{[{O_{O}^{2-}}{H^+}]}^{1-}}$ defect complex creates a spectrally-broad ($\sim$0.3 eV FWHM) distribution of electronic states observed in the bandgap centered at 0.4 eV above the valence band mobility edge.</summary>

    <title>Electron-proton Co-doping Induced Metal-insulator Transition in VO2 Film via Surface Self-assembled Ascorbic Acid Molecules</title>

    <summary>Charge doping is an effective way to induce metal-insulate transition (MIT) in correlated materials for many important utilizations, which is however practically limited by problem of low stability. In this study, we have achieved pronounced phase modulation and stabilized the metallic state of monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2) at room temperature, via a novel electron-proton co-doping mechanism driven by surface absorption of self-assembled L-ascorbic acid (AA) molecules. The ionized AA- species in solution donate effective electrons to the adsorbed VO2 surface, which then electrostatically attract surrounding protons to penetrate, and eventually results in stable hydrogen-doped metallic VO2. The variations of phase and electronic structures as well as the electron occupancy of V-3d/O-2p hybrid orbitals were examined by synchrotron characterizations and first-principle theoretical simulations, which explain the formation of stable metallic state. Importantly, the adsorbed molecules protect hydrogen dopants from escaping out of lattice and thereby stabilize the metallic phase for VO2. Such an electron-proton co-doping mechanism driven by suitable molecules absorption would open a new door for engineering properties of correlated oxide materials.</summary>

    <title>Estimated electric conductivities of thermal plasma for air-fuel combustion and oxy-fuel combustion with potassium or cesium seeding</title>

    <summary>A complete model for estimating the electric conductivity of combustion product gases, with added cesium (Cs) or potassium (K) vapor for ionization, is presented. Neutral carrier gases serve as the bulk fluid that carries the seed material, as well as the electrons generated by the partial thermal (equilibrium) ionization of the seed alkali metal. The model accounts for electron-neutral scattering, as well as electron-ion and electron-electron scattering. The model is tested through comparison with published data. The model is aimed at being utilized for the plasma within magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channels, where direct power extraction from passing electrically conducting plasma gas enables electric power generation. The thermal ionization model is then used to estimate the electric conductivity of seeded combustion gases under complete combustion of three selected fuels, namely: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon (C). For each of these three fuels, two options for the oxidizer were applied, namely: air (21 % molecular oxygen, 79 % molecular nitrogen by mole), and pure oxygen (oxy-combustion). Two types of seeds (with 1 % mole fraction, based on the composition before ionization) were also applied for each of the six combinations of (fuel-oxidizer), leading to a total of 12 different MHD plasma cases. For each of these cases, the electric conductivity was computed for a range of temperatures from 2000 K to 3000 K. The smallest estimated electric conductivity was 0.35 S/m for oxy-hydrogen combustion at 2000 K, with potassium seeding. The largest estimated electric conductivity was 180.30 S/m for oxy-carbon combustion at 3000 K, with cesium seeding. At 2000 K, replacing potassium with cesium causes a gain in the electric conductivity by a multiplicative gain factor of about 3.6 regardless of the fuel and oxidizer. This gain factor declines to between 1.77 and 2.07 at 3000 K.</summary>
