    <summary>The reduction of iron ore with carbon-carriers is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, motivating global activities to replace the coke-based blast furnace reduction by hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR). Iron oxide reduction with hydrogen has been widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The process includes multiple types of chemical reactions, solid state and defect-mediated diffusion (by oxygen and hydrogen species), several phase transformations, as well as massive volume shrinkage and mechanical stress buildup. In this work, a chemo-mechanically coupled phase-field (PF) model has been developed to explore the interplay between phase transformation, chemical reaction, species diffusion, large elasto-plastic deformation and microstructure evolution. Energetic constitutive relations of the model are based on the system free energy which is calibrated with the help of a thermodynamic database. The model has been first applied to the classical core-shell (wüstite-iron) structure. Simulations show that the phase transformation from wüstite to alpha-iron can result in high stress and rapidly decelerating reaction kinetics. Mechanical stresses can contribute elastic energy to the system, making phase transformation difficult. Thus slow reaction kinetics and low metallization are observed. However, if the stress becomes comparatively high, it can shift the shape of the free energy from a double-well to a single-well case and speed up the transformation. The model has been further applied to simulate an actual iron oxide specimen with its complex microstructure, characterized by electron microscopy. The simulation results show that isolated pores in the microstructure are filled with water vapor during reduction, an effect which influences the local reaction atmosphere and dynamics.</summary>

    <summary>We demonstrate that ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) can be used for in situ studies of dynamic changes in surface chemistry in a plasma environment. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was used in this study as a model system since it exhibits a wide array of unique chemical, optical, and electrical properties that make it a prospective material for advanced electronics. To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN during plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with single-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in real-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS equipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual gas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS to track reaction products formed during plasma exposure. A clear reduction of CuxO is seen, while an h-BN layer remains intact, suggesting H radical species can attack the exposed and h-BN-covered Cu oxide patches and partially reduce the underlying substrate. In addition to the demonstration and discussion of plasma-XPS capabilities, our results indicate the h-BN encapsulated metallic Cu interface might be repaired without significantly damaging the overlaying h-BN, which is of practical importance for the development of h-BN encapsulated devices and interfaces</summary>

    <title>Deuterium permeation in Er$_2$O$_3$ thin film fabricated on a type 316L stainless steel substrate</title>

    <summary>A metal-oxide film can be used as a hydrogen-isotope permeation barrier in the fuel circulation system for nuclear fusion. We fabricated Er$_2$O$_3$ thin film on a type 316L stainless-steel substrate by using a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition technique for the purpose of hydrogen-isotope permeation barrier. Electron microscopy based imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicate a sound film quality together with X-ray diffraction experiments. We also measured deuterium permeation in the film at high temperatures ranging from 600 $^{\circ}$C to 800 $^{\circ}$C. The permeation reduction was most apparent at 650 $^{\circ}$C. Above 800 $^{\circ}$C, we confirmed that the film was damaged and did not work as a permeation barrier.</summary>
