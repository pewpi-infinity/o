    <summary>Anyon usually exists as collective excitation of two dimensional electron gas subjected to strong magnetic field, carrying fractional charges and exotic statistical character beyond fermion and boson. Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is the only experimental system showing solid evidence of anyon and a serial of fractional charges so far. Searching for new serial of fractional charges in FQHE or other physical system is still a challenge for both theoretical and experimental study. Here a topological fusion theory of propagating paths winding around a pair of fluxes is proposed to explore the physical origin of fractional charges. This topological path fusion theory not only generated all of the existed serial of fractional charges in FQHE and found the exact correspondence between FQHE and integral quantum Hall effect (IQHE), but also predicted new serial of fractional charges in FQHE. Further more, serial irrational charges like $2/(3+\sqrt{2})$ in one dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes as well as that in two dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes, such as $(1+\sqrt{2})$, are predicted. Even in three dimensional network of magnetic fluxes, a serial of fractionally charged anyon is predicted by this topological path fusion theory, which has exactly correspondence with the knot lattice model of anyon. In fact, in a multi-connected space time without magnetic field, this topological path fusion theory still holds, revealing an universal existence of fractional charge and mass in quantum material with strong confinement of particles (such as photonic crystal with porous nano-structures) and paving a new way for topological quantum computation.</summary>

    <summary>In this work, we study the properties of magnetized white dwarfs taking into account possible instabilities due to electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion reactions in the cores of such objects. The structure of white dwarfs is obtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a poloidal magnetic field in a fully general relativistic approach. The stellar interior is composed of a regular crystal lattice made of carbon ions immersed in a degenerate relativistic electron gas. The onsets of electron capture reactions and pycnonuclear reactions are determined with and without magnetic fields. We find that magnetized white dwarfs violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit significantly, even when electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion reactions are present in the stellar interior. We obtain a maximum white dwarf mass of around $2.14\,M_{\odot}$ for a central magnetic field of $\sim 3.85\times 10^{14}$~G, which indicates that magnetized white dwarfs may play a role for the interpretation of superluminous type Ia supernovae. Furthermore, we show that the critical density for pycnonuclear fusion reactions limits the central white dwarf density to $9.35\times 10^9$ g/cm$^3$. As a result, equatorial radii of white dwarfs cannot be smaller than $\sim 1100$~km. Another interesting feature concerns the relationship between the central stellar density and the strength of the magnetic field at the core of a magnetized white dwarf. For high magnetic fields, we find that the central density increases (stellar radius decrease) with magnetic field strength, which makes ultramagnetized white dwarfs more compact. The opposite is the case, however, if the central magnetic field is less than $\sim 10^{13}$~G. In the latter case, the central density decreases (stellar radius increases) with central magnetic field strengths.</summary>

    <title>Models for nuclear fusion in the solid state</title>

    <summary>This article presents a theoretical framework for enhancing nuclear fusion rates in solid-state environments under near-ambient conditions. Drawing on quantum tunneling, electron screening, and resonance energy transfer, the study proposes rate enhancements of more than 40 orders of magnitude for deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion in palladium lattices. A generalized nuclear Dicke model describes a fusion-fission process as a result of energy transfer between D-D and palladium mediated by lattice vibrations. Practical challenges such as decoherence, destructive interference, receiver decay, and achieving resonance between donor and receiver systems are addressed. Experimental strategies to validate the model are proposed along with its implications for the advancement of solid-state fusion as a potential pathway to sustainable energy technologies.</summary>
