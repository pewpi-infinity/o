    <summary>Memristors have been at the forefront of nanoelectronics research for the last decade, offering a valuable component to reconfigurable computing. Their attributes have been studied extensively along with applications that leverage their state-dependent programmability in a static fashion. However, practical applications of memristor-based AC circuits have been rather sparse, with only a few examples found in the literature where their use is emulated at higher frequencies. In this work, we study the behavior of metal-oxide memristors under an AC perturbation in a range of frequencies, from 10^3 to 10^7 Hz. Metal-oxide memristors are found to behave as RC low-pass filters and they present a variable cut-off frequency when their state is switched, thus providing a window of reconfigurability when used as filters. We further study this behaviour across distinct material systems and we show that the usable reconfigurability window of the devices can be tailored to encompass specific frequency ranges by amending the devices' capacitance. This study extends current knowledge on metal-oxide memristors by characterising their frequency dependent characteristics, providing useful insights for their use in reconfigurable AC circuits.</summary>

    <title>A disclosure of the role of frequency on the plasma electrolytic oxidation of AZ31 magnesium alloy in aluminate-tungstate electrolyte</title>

    <summary>Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) was carried out to form black ceramic coatings on AZ31 magnesium alloy in aluminate-tungstate electrolyte. Influences of current frequency (such as 100, 1000 and 2000 Hz) on properties of the PEO coatings have been explored. It was found that increment of frequency led to coatings with higher thickness, higher roughness and darker appearance. In order to explore the coating formation mechanism at different frequencies, the micro-discharges at different frequencies were investigated by real-time imaging method. Microstructure of coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assisted with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Coatings formed at 100 Hz show the most compact microstructure while porosity of the coatings, both in the pore number and pore size, is greatly increased at higher frequencies. The coatings formed at higher frequencies show an increased atomic ratio of W/Al. The cancel of the negative pulse from the pulsed waveform can also lead to a higher W/Al ratio, and hence a darker coating. The higher porosity of the coatings was attributed to the stronger plasma discharges and gas evolution at higher frequencies. The stronger plasma discharge is induced by the fact that there is not sufficient time for the cooling down of discharge channels at higher frequencies.</summary>

    <title>Chemical Interface Damping by Electrochemical Gold Oxidation</title>

    <summary>Chemical interface damping is a change in the effective collision frequency of conduction band electrons in metal originating from a chemical change of the metal interface. In this work, we present in-situ ellipsometric measurements that reveal the chemical interface damping effect from electrochemical oxidation of single crystal and polycrystalline gold films. We observe an increase in collision frequency of up to 21 meV for single-crystalline gold. To compare to results obtained with thiols and metal-oxides on gold nanoparticles, we normalize the collision frequency by the electron mean free path to the surface of the structure. We show that electrochemical gold oxidation provides a stronger effect on collision frequency than these coatings. Similar ellipsometric experiments have previously been conducted to investigate the optical properties of gold oxide, but without taking chemical interface damping into account. The change in reflection from oxidation of gold was solely attributed to the oxide coating. We also show that the chemical interface damping effect saturates at a larger effective oxide thickness, which is attributed to the stabilization of the gold-oxide interface.</summary>
