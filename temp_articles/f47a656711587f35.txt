    <summary>  A complete set of cross sections is reported for the ionization of water molecules by neutral atomic hydrogen impact at velocities of the order of the Bragg peak. The measured relative cross sections are normalized by comparison with proton impact results for the same target conditions and previous absolute data. Event by event coincidence analysis of the product ions and the projectile enables partial cross sections for target ionization and target plus projectile ionization to be determined, as well as total cross sections for electron loss reactions.</summary>

    <title>On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma</title>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>

    <title>Net electron capture in collisions of multiply charged projectiles with biologically relevant molecules</title>

    <summary>A model for the description of proton collisions from molecules composed of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus (H, C, N, O, P) was recently extended to treat collisions with multiply charged ions with a focus on net ionization. Here we complement the work by focusing on net capture. The ion-atom collisions are computed using the two-center basis generator method. The atomic net capture cross sections are then used to assemble two models for ion-molecule collisions: an independent atom model (IAM) based on the Bragg additivity rule (labeled IAM-AR), and also the so-called pixel-counting method (IAM-PCM) which introduces dependence on the orientation of the molecule during impact. The IAM-PCM leads to significantly reduced capture cross sections relative to IAM-AR at low energies, since it takes into account the overlap of effective atomic cross sectional areas. We compare our results with available experimental and other theoretical data focusing on water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and uracil (C4H4N2O2). For the water molecule target we also provide results from a classical-trajectory Monte Carlo approach that includes dynamical screening effects on projectile and target. For small molecules dominated by a many-electron atom, such as carbon in methane, or oxygen in water we find a saturation phenomenon for higher projectile charges (Q = 3) and low energies, where the net capture cross section for the molecule is dominated by the net cross section for the many-electron atom, and the net capture cross section is not proportional to the total number of valence electrons.</summary>
