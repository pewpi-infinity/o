    <summary>This report is a primarily survey on the chemical nature of some exotic species containing the positively charged muon and the muonic Helium, i.e., the negatively charged muon plus helium nucleus, as exotic isotopes of hydrogen, using the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (MC-QTAIM) analysis, employing ab initio non-Born-Oppenhiemer wavefunctions. Accordingly, the "atoms in molecules" analysis performed on various asymmetric exotic isotopomers of hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally [Science 331, 448 (2011)], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are capable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen atom. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing muonic helium cast no doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of hydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon are more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of appreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization; however, with some tolerance, they may be categorized also as hydrogen basins though with a smaller electronegativity. All in all, present study also clearly demonstrates that the MC-QTAIM analysis is an efficient approach to decipher the chemical nature of species containing exotic constituents, hard to be elucidated by experimental and/or alternative theoretical schemes.</summary>

    <summary>We show that, in the relativistic Bohm model of a Dirac-like particle, the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom is moving, unlike the prediction for the case of a Schrödinger-like particle, where the electron is stationary. This accounts for the empirically observed dilation of the decay time of the muon in the ground state of muonium.</summary>

    <title>Toward a muon-specific electronic structure theory: Effective electronic Hartree-Fock equations for the muonic molecules</title>
    <updated>2017-11-11T16:06:37Z</updated>

    <summary>An effective set of the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations are derived for electrons of the muonic systems, i.e., molecules containing a positively charged muon, conceiving the muon as a quantum oscillator, which are completely equivalent to the usual two-component HF equations used to derive stationary states of the muonic molecules. In these effective equations, a non-Coulombic potential is added to the orthodox coulomb and exchange potential energy terms, which describes the interaction of the muon and the electrons effectively and is optimized during the self-consistent field cycles. While in the two-component HF equations muon is treated as a quantum wave, in the effective HF equations it is absorbed into the effective potential and practically transformed into an effective potential field experienced by electrons. The explicit form of the effective potential depends on the nature of muon vibrations and is derivable from the basis set used to expand the muonic spatial orbital. The resulting effective Hartree-Fock equations are implemented computationally and used successfully, as a proof of concept, in a series of the muonic molecules containing all atoms from the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. To solve the algebraic version of the equations muon-specific gaussian basis sets are designed for both muon and surrounding electrons and it is demonstrated that the optimized exponents are quite distinct from those derived for the hydrogen isotopes. The developed effective HF theory is quite general and in principle can be used for any muonic system while it is the starting point for a general effective electronic structure theory that incorporates various types of quantum correlations into the muonic systems beyond the HF equations.</summary>
