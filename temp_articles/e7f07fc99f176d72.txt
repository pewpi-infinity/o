    <summary>In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</summary>

    <title>Enhanced superconductivity of hydrogenated $β_{12}$ borophene</title>

    <summary>Borophene stands out among elemental two-dimensional materials due to its extraordinary physical properties, including structural polymorphism, strong anisotropy, metallicity, and the potential for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, confirming superconductivity in borophene experimentally has been evasive to date, mainly due to the detrimental effects of metallic substrates and its susceptibility to oxidation. In this study, we present an \textit{ab initio} analysis of superconductivity in the experimentally synthesized hydrogenated $β_{12}$ borophene, which has been proven to be less prone to oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that hydrogenation significantly enhances both the stability and superconducting properties of $β_{12}$ borophene. Furthermore, we reveal that tensile strain and hole doping, achievable through various experimental methods, significantly enhance the critical temperature, reaching up to 29 K. These findings not only promote further fundamental research on superconducting borophene and its heterostructures, but also position hydrogenated borophene as a versatile platform for low-dimensional superconducting electronics.</summary>

    <summary>The search for room-temperature superconductors is a major challenge in modern physics. The discovery of copper-oxide superconductors in 1986 brought hope but also revealed complex mechanisms that are difficult to analyze and compute. In contrast, the traditional electron-phonon coupling (EPC) mechanism facilitated the practical realization of superconductivity in metallic hydrogen. Since 2015, the discovery of new hydrogen compounds has shown that EPC can enable room-temperature superconductivity under high pressures, driving extensive research. Advances in computational capabilities, especially exascale computing, now allow for the exploration of millions of materials. This paper reviews newly predicted superconducting systems in 2023-2024, focusing on hydrides, boron-carbon systems, and compounds with nitrogen, carbon, and pure metals. Although many computationally predicted high-Tc superconductors were not experimentally confirmed, some low-temperature superconductors were successfully synthesized. This paper provides a review of these developments and future research directions.</summary>
