    <summary>In this paper we present experimental data of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation obtained in a high purity crystalline sample of cooper hydrogenated by gaseous charge. The sample is oriented in the &lt;111&gt; crystallographic direction and aged for this work in three stages between 64 and 97 days. The results indicate that the hydrogen is mainly segregated at the dislocation core, inhibiting the Hydrogen Snoek-Köster relaxations verified at earlier aging stages. Despite of this, a contribution to viscosity in the kink-chain resonance is provided by the mobile hydrogen in the dislocations core by its side movement along the dislocation line. At temperatures at which the hydrogen begins to freeze in the lattice the geometrical kinks find a gradual increase on the hindering of their movements along dislocation lines, becoming immobile when the hydrogen is completely frozen in the crystal, anchoring the dislocations in short loops. Although the viscosity associated with the mobile hydrogen is removed, the resonance associated with geometrical kinks is not completely cancelled. The interaction hydrogen-dislocation can be fully described in terms of kinks in dislocations.</summary>

    <summary>Low-energy excitations of a single water molecule are studied when confined within a nano-size cage formed by the ionic crystal lattice. Optical spectra are measured of manganese doped beryl single crystal Mn:Be3Al2Si6O18, that contains water molecules individually isolated in 0.51 nm diameter voids within the crystal lattice. Two types of orientation are distinguished: water-I molecules have their dipole moments aligned perpendicular to the c axis, and dipole moments of water-II molecules are parallel to the c-axis. The optical conductivity and permittivity spectra are recorded in terahertz and infrared ranges, at frequencies from several wavenumbers up to 7000cm-1, at temperatures from 5K to 300K and for two polarizations, when the electric vector E of the radiation is parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. Comparative experiments on as-grown and on dehydrated samples allow to identify the conductivity and permittivity spectra caused exclusively by water molecules. In the infrared range well-known internal modes nu1, nu2 and nu3 of the H2O molecule are observed for both polarizations, indicating the presence of water-I and water-II molecules in the crystal. Spectra recorded below 1000cm-1 reveal a rich set of highly anisotropic features in the low-energy response of H2O molecule in a crystalline nanocage. While for E parallel to c only two absorption peaks are detected, at 90cm-1 and 160cm-1, several absorption bands are discovered for E perpendicular to c, each consisting of narrower resonances. The bands are assigned to librational and translational vibrations of water-I molecule that is weakly, via hydrogen bonds, coupled to the nanocage walls. A model is presented that explains the fine structure of the bands by splitting of the energy levels due to quantum tunneling between the minima in a six-well potential relief felt by a molecule within the cage.</summary>

    <title>Topological features of hydrogenated graphene</title>

    <summary>Hydrogen adatoms are one of the most the promising proposals for the functionalization of graphene. Hydrogen induces narrow resonances near the Dirac energy, which lead to the formation of magnetic moments. Furthermore, they also create local lattice distortions which enhance the spin-orbit coupling. The combination of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling allows for a rich variety of phases, some of which have non trivial topological features. We analyze the interplay between magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in ordered arrays of hydrogen on graphene monolayers, and classify the different phases that may arise. We extend our model to consider arrays of adsorbates in graphene-like crystals with stronger intrinsic spin-orbit couplings.</summary>
