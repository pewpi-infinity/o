    <summary>  Graphene - a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagonal lattice - has one of the strongest possible atomic bonds and can be viewed as a robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups. Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and, essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains the hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties.</summary>

    <title>Donor-acceptor recombination emission in hydrogen-terminated nanodiamond: Novel single-photon source for room-temperature quantum photonics</title>

    <summary>In fluorescence spectra of nanodiamonds (NDs) synthesized at high pressure from adamantane and other organic compounds, very narrow (~1 nm) lines of unknown origin are observed in a wide spectroscopic range from ~500 to 800 nm. Here, we propose and experimentally substantiate the hypothesis that these mysterious lines arise from radiative recombination of donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs). To confirm our hypothesis, we study the fluorescence spectra of undoped and nitrogen-doped NDs of different sizes, before and after thermal oxidation of their surface. The results obtained with a high degree of confidence allowed us to conclude that the DAPs are formed through the interaction of donor-like substitutional nitrogen present in the diamond lattice, and a 2D layer of acceptors resulting from the transfer doping effect on the surface of hydrogen-terminated NDs. A specific behavior of the DAP-induced lines was discovered in the temperature range of 100-10 K: their energy increases and most lines are split into 2 or more components with decreasing temperature. It is shown that the majority of the studied DAP emitters are sources of single photons, with an emission rate of up to &gt;1 million counts/s at room temperature, which significantly surpasses that of nitrogen-vacancy and silicon-vacancy centers under the same detection conditions. Despite an observed temporal instability in the emission, the DAP emitters of H-terminated NDs represent a powerful room-temperature single-photon source for quantum optical technologies.</summary>

    <title>Exciton mass and exciton spectrum in the cuprous oxide</title>

    <summary>Excitons with a radius of a few lattice constants can be affected by strong central-cell corrections, leading to significant deviations of the optical spectrum from the hydrogen-like Rydberg series, and also to an enhancement of the exciton mass. We present an approach to this situation based on a lattice model that incorporates the effects of a non-parabolic band structure, short distance corrections to the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, spin-orbit and exchange coupling. The lattice model allows for observation of the crossover from large radius Wannier to small radius Frenkel excitons without invoking a continuum approximation. We apply the lattice model approach especially to the yellow exciton series in the cuprous oxide, for which the optical spectrum and exciton mass enhancement are obtained through adaptation of only a few model parameters to material-specific values. Our results predict a strongly anisotropic ortho-exciton mass.</summary>
