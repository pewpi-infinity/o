    <summary>This work reports the peculiar properties of a graphene film prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ethylene in high vacuum on a well oriented and carefully cleaned Pt(111) crystal surface maintained at high temperature. In-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques (low energy electron diffraction, high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy) used here indicate the prevalence of single layer regions and the presence of two different orientations of the graphene sheets with respect to the Pt(111) substrate. In most of the deposited area evidence is found of a compressive stress for the graphene lattice, as a net result of the growth process on a metal substrate. This graphene film grown on Pt(111) exhibits a lower degree of order and of homogeneity with respect to the exfoliated graphene on Si/SiO2, as it is found generally for graphene on metals, but several characterization techniques indicates a better quality than in previous deposition experiments on the same metal substrate.</summary>

    <title>Influence of Chemisorbed Oxygen on the Growth of Graphene on Cu(100) by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>

    <summary>Understanding the influence that copper substrate surface symmetry and oxygen impurities have on the growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition is important for developing techniques for producing high quality graphene. Therefore, we have studied the growth of graphene by catalytic decomposition of ethylene in an ultra-high vacuum chamber on both a clean Cu(100) surface and a Cu(100) surface pre-dosed with a layer of chemisorbed oxygen. The crystal structure of the graphene films was characterized with \emph{in-situ} low energy electron diffraction. By heating the clean Cu(100) substrate from room temperature to the growth temperature in ethylene, epitaxial graphene films were formed. The crystal quality was found to depend strongly on the growth temperature. At 900 $^\circ$C, well-ordered two-domain graphene films were formed. Pre-dosing the Cu(100) surface with a chemisorbed layer of oxygen before graphene growth was found to adversely affect the crystal quality of the graphene overlayer by inducing a much higher degree of rotational disorder of the graphene grains with respect to the Cu(100) substrate. The growth morphology of the graphene islands during the initial stages of nucleation was monitored with \emph{ex-situ} scanning electron microscopy. The nucleation rate of the graphene islands was observed to drop by an order of magnitude by pre-dosing the Cu(100) surface with a chemisorbed oxygen layer before growth. This reduction in nucleation rate results in the formation of much larger graphene islands. Therefore, the presence of oxygen during graphene growth affects both the relative orientation and average size of grains within the films grown on Cu(100) substrates.</summary>

    <title>The influence of residual oxidizing impurities on the synthesis of graphene by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition</title>

    <summary>The growth of graphene on copper by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition in a system free of pumping equipment is investigated. The emphasis is put on the necessity of hydrogen presence during graphene synthesis and cooling. In the absence of hydrogen during the growth step or cooling at slow rate, weak carbon coverage, consisting mostly of oxidized and amorphous carbon, is obtained on the copper catalyst. The oxidation originates from the inevitable occurrence of residual oxidizing impurities in the reactor's atmosphere. Graphene with appreciable coverage can be grown within the vacuum-free furnace only upon admitting hydrogen during the growth step. After formation, it is preserved from the destructive effect of residual oxidizing contaminants once exposure at high temperature is minimized by fast cooling or hydrogen flow. Under these conditions, micrometer-sized hexagon-shaped graphene domains of high structural quality are achieved.</summary>
