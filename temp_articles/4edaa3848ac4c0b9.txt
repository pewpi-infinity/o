    <summary>Muon spin rotation and relaxation experiments in the pyrochlore iridate Eu2Ir2O7 yield a well-defined muon spin precession frequency below the metal-insulator/antiferromagnetic transition temperature TM = 120 K, indicative of long-range commensurate magnetic order and thus ruling out quantum spin liquid and spin-glass-like ground states. The dynamic muon spin relaxation rate is temperature-independent between 2 K and ~TM and yields an anomalously long Ir^{4+} spin correlation time, suggesting a singular density of low-lying spin excitations. Similar behavior is found in other pyrochlores and geometrically frustrated systems, but also in the unfrustrated iridate BaIrO3. Eu2Ir2O7 may be only weakly frustrated; if so, the singularity might be associated with the small-gap insulating state rather than frustration.</summary>

    <summary>The loop-current state discovered in under-doped cuprates is characterized by a vector ${\bf Ω}$ which has four possible orientations which correspond to different domains of order in a perfect sample. Since translational symmetry remains unchanged in the pure limit, no gap occurs at the chemical potential. On the other hand Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has revealed that the magnitude of the pseudo-gap in under-doped cuprates varies spatially and is correlated with disorder. For disorder coupling also to the direction of ${\bf Ω}$, there can only be a finite temperature dependent static correlation length for the loop-current state below the ordering temperature of the pure problem. It is shown that, in this situation, singular forward scattering of fermions for large correlation lengths induces an angle dependent pseudo-gap in the single-particle spectral function near the chemical potential. The peaks in the spectral function at the fermi-vectors are away from the chemical potential proportionally to the square of the average loop order parameter measurable by polarized neutron scattering. This result is tested. Due to the finite correlation length there always exist low frequency excitations at long wavelength at all temperatures in the "ordered" phase. Such fluctuations motionally average over the shifts in frequencies of local probes such as NMR and muon resonance expected for a truly static order.</summary>

    <title>Two-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations with Spectral Neutrino Transport II. Models for Different Progenitor Stars</title>

    <summary>  1D and 2D supernova simulations for stars between 11 and 25 solar masses are presented, making use of the Prometheus/Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code, which employs a full spectral treatment of the neutrino transport. Multi-dimensional transport aspects are treated by the ``ray-by-ray plus'' approximation described in Paper I. Our set of models includes a 2D calculation for a 15 solar mass star whose iron core is assumed to rotate rigidly with an angular frequency of 0.5 rad/s before collapse. No important differences were found depending on whether random seed perturbations for triggering convection are included already during core collapse, or whether they are imposed on a 1D collapse model shortly after bounce. Convection below the neutrinosphere sets in about 40 ms p.b. at a density above 10**12 g/cm^3 in all 2D models, and encompasses a layer of growing mass as time goes on. It leads to a more extended proto-neutron star structure with accelerated lepton number and energy loss and significantly higher muon and tau neutrino luminosities, but reduced mean energies of the radiated neutrinos, at times later than ~100 ms p.b. In case of an 11.2 solar mass star we find that low (l = 1,2) convective modes cause a probably rather weak explosion by the convectively supported neutrino-heating mechanism after ~150 ms p.b. when the 2D simulation is performed with a full 180 degree grid, whereas the same simulation with 90 degree wedge fails to explode like all other models. This sensitivity demonstrates the proximity of our 2D models to the borderline between success and failure, and stresses the need of simulations in 3D, ultimately without the axis singularity of a polar grid.
