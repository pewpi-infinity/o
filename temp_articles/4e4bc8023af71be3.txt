    <summary>Sympathetic laser cooling of a single mode graphene membrane coupled to an atomic cloud interacting via Casimir-Polder forces has been recently proposed. Here, we extend this study to the effect of secondary graphene membrane whose frequency may be far or close to resonance. We show that if the two mechanical modes are close together, it is possible to simultaneously cool both modes. Conversely, if the two frequencies are set far apart, the secondary mode does not affect the cooling of the first one. We also study the entanglement properties of the steady-state using the logarithmic negativity. We show how stationary mechanical entanglement between two graphene sheets can be generated by means of vacuum fluctuations. Moreover, we find that, within feasible experimental parameters, large steady-state acoustomechanical entanglement, i.e. entanglement between the phononic and mechanical mode, $E_N \approx 5$, can be generated.</summary>

    <summary>We address the two-dimensional band-structure of graphene above the vacuum level in the context of discrete states immersed in the three-dimensional continuum. Scattering resonances are discovered that originate from the coupling of the in-plane and perpendicular motions, as elucidated by the analysis of an exactly solvable model. Some of the resonances turn into true bound states at high-symmetry $\kv$ vectors. {\it Ab initio} scattering theory verifies the existence of the resonances in realistic graphene and shows that they lead to a total reflection of the incident electron below and total transmission above the resonance energy.</summary>

    <title>Graphene Resonant Pressure Sensor with Ultrahigh Responsivity</title>

    <summary>Graphene has good mechanical properties including large Young's modulus, making it ideal for many resonant sensing applications. Nonetheless, the development of graphene based sensors has been limited due to difficulties in fabrication, encapsulation, and packaging. Here we report a graphene nanoresonator based resonant pressure sensor. The graphene nano resonator is fabricated on a thin silicon diaphragm that deforms due to pressure differential across it. The deformation-induced strain change results in a resonance frequency shift of the graphene nano resonator. The pressure sensing experiments demonstrate a record high responsivity of 20Hz/Pa with a resolution of 90Pa. The resolution of the sensing scheme is 0.003% of the full-scale range of the pressure sensor. This exceptional performance is attributed to two factors: maintaining a high-quality vacuum environment for the nanoresonator and introducing stimuli through a thin silicon diaphragm. The proposed pressure sensor design provides flexibility to adjust responsivity and range as needed. The fabrication method is simple and has the potential to be integrated with standard CMOS fabrication. The innovative substrate packaging allows the coupling of the resonator's strain with pressure.</summary>
