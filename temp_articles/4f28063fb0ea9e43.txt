    <title>On the possible new 750 GeV heavy boson resonance at the LHC</title>

    <summary>We argue that the possible new heavy boson resonance of 750 GeV is an ideal candidate as a twin particle of the 125 GeV scalar boson, both emerging from the large mixing of the scalar toponium and scalar gluonium. The twin pseudoscalar particles are expected to have smaller masses. The discovery of the 750 GeV resonance is possible only with a much more data than for the 125 GeV resonance since only the gluonium component is detectable above the toponium threshold. The similar type of the QCD resonances is expected in the bottomonium-gluonium system. If the LHC will discover all these heavy quarkonium-gluonium resonances, the absence of the Higgs scalar should not be considered an obstacle because the nonsingular theory with the UV cutoff fixed by the weak boson masses is superior to the Standard Model. Namely, it solves the basic problems for the SM such as: (1) the existence of light neutrinos, (2) dark matter particles to be the heavy Majorana neutrinos and (3) broken lepton and baryon numbers.</summary>

    <summary>Among the questions that would be raised by the observation of a new resonance at the LHC, particularly pressing are those concerning the production mechanism: What is the initial state? Is the resonance produced independently or in association with other particles? Here we present two weakly-coupled renormalizable models for production of a diphoton resonance that differ in both their initial and final states. In one model, a scalar particle produced through gluon fusion decays into a diphoton particle and a light, long-lived pseudoscalar. In another model, a $Z'$ boson produced from the annihilation of a strange-antistrange quark pair undergoes a cascade decay that leads to a diphoton particle and two sterile neutrinos. Various kinematic distributions may differentiate these models from the canonical model where a diphoton particle is directly produced in gluon fusion.</summary>

    <title>Dynamics of the spin-boson model with a structured environment</title>

    <summary>  We investigate the dynamics of the spin-boson model when the spectral density of the boson bath shows a resonance at a characteristic frequency $Ω$ but behaves Ohmically at small frequencies. The time evolution of an initial state is determined by making use of the mapping onto a system composed of a quantum mechanical two-state system (TSS) which is coupled to a harmonic oscillator (HO) with frequency $Ω$. The HO itself is coupled to an Ohmic environment. The dynamics is calculated by employing the numerically exact quasiadiabatic path-integral propagator technique. We find significant new properties compared to the Ohmic spin-boson model. By reducing the TSS-HO system in the dressed states picture to a three-level system for the special case at resonance, we calculate the dephasing rates for the TSS analytically. Finally, we apply our model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to an underdamped dc-SQUID detector.</summary>
