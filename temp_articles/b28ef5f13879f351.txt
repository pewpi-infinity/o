    <summary>Nb3Sn superconducting strands are the most practical conductors to generate high magnetic fields (12-16 T), and thus have significant applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and great potential for fusion reactors and particle accelerator magnets. High critical current density (Jc) is a key parameter for such applications. Significant efforts towards optimization of various factors led to an 80% improvement in Jc from the early 1990s to 2003, when the 4.2 K, 12 T non-matrix Jc reached 3000 A/mm2 (corresponding to 5000 A/mm2 in Nb3Sn layer Jc). However, further efforts over the past decade have failed to bring about further increase beyond this level, leading some researchers to conclude that the Jc of conventional Nb3Sn strands had reached its maximum. Here, however, by applying an internal oxidation method, we reduce the grain size by a factor of three and nearly double the 12 T Jc. In this method, a Nb3Sn strand is fabricated with Nb-Zr alloy as starting material; with oxygen supplied properly via an oxide powder, the Zr atoms in the Nb-Zr alloy are internally oxidized, forming fine intra-granular and inter-granular ZrO2 particles in Nb3Sn layer, which effectively refine Nb3Sn grain size. At a reaction temperature of 625 °C, grain size down to 20-50 nm (36 nm on average) has been achieved. For this sample the 4.2 K, 12 T Nb3Sn layer Jc reached 9600 A/mm2.</summary>

    <title>ARC: A compact, high-field, fusion nuclear science facility and demonstration power plant with demountable magnets</title>

    <summary>The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor conceptual design study aims to reduce the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a 200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio &gt;= 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a high-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.</summary>

    <title>Radiation Damage and Thermal Recovery of Perovskite Superconductor Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide</title>

    <summary>High temperature superconducting materials are being considered to generate the magnetic fields required for the confinement of plasma in fusion reactors. The present study aims to assess the microstructural degradation resulting from ion implantation at room temperature under two implantation conditions in Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) tapes. Xray Diffraction (XRD) and high resolution characterisation techniques including Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses were used to correlate alterations in superconducting behaviour measured using a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) to amorphization and recovery caused by ion implantation. TEM analysis was performed to depth profile the degree of crystallinity (or lack thereof) on irradiated samples. SRIM predicted the damage depth at 900 nm below the sample surface of the 2 MeV Xe implanted sample and 450 nm beneath the surface of the 0.6 MeV Xe implanted sample. 2 MeV Xe implantation caused the superconducting temperature to decrease by 10 K and the critical current density to display a 10 fold reduction. Post irradiation heat treatments up to 600C caused recrystallisation of the irradiated layer, but also oxygen loss and alterations in grain size. The recrystallised grain orientation was random in TEM lamellae, however, bulk samples re-grew along the original crystal orientation provided that some of the original material was not amorphized (ie if they nucleated on crystalline YBCO). This is extremely promising for the thermal recovery of tokamak components.</summary>
