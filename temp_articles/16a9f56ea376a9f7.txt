    <summary>We employ several X-ray based techniques, including X-ray diffraction, absorption and resonant inelastic scattering, to disentangle the contributions of individual chemical species to the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of high-entropy oxides. In the benchmark compound Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and related systems, we unambiguously resolve a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion at the Cu sites, more pronounced in the absence of Ni2+ and Mg2+, suggesting that these ions promote positional order, whereas Cu2+ ions act to destabilize it. Moreover, we detect magnetic excitations and estimate the strength of the interactions between pairs of different magnetic elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of the various chemical species in shaping the physical properties of high-entropy oxides.</summary>

    <title>Microwave-assisted synthesis of LaMnO3+d: Tuning physical properties with microwave power</title>

    <summary>Synthesis of transition metal oxides by microwave irradiation is a faster and energy-saving method compared to conventional heating in an electrical furnace because microwave energy is directly converted into heat within precursors. However, not much is known about how the physical properties are modified by the power of microwaves. We synthesized LaMnO3+d by irradiating oxide precursors with microwaves and studied the impact of microwave power (P = 1000 W, 1200 W, 1400 W and 1600 W) on magnetism, resistivity, magnetoresistance, thermopower, magnetic entropy change, magnetostriction, and electron spin resonance. It is found that paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition becomes sharper, saturation magnetization increases, and electrical resistivity at low temperatures dramatically decreases as P increases. While the resistivity of samples irradiated with MW power of P less than or equal to 1400 W show insulating-like behavior down to 50 K, an insulator-metal transition occurs in the sample exposed to P = 1600 W and this sample also shows a maximum magnetoresistance (= -55%), magneto-thermopower (=-87%), magnetostriction (-180 x10-6) for H = 50 kOe and magnetic entropy change of 4.78 J/kg. K for H = 30 kOe around the Curie temperature. The intensity of electron spin resonance spectra at 300 K increases with P. We postulate that the much enhanced physical properties observed for the P = 1600 W sample arise from the creation of higher hole density, chemical homogeneity, and increased grain size. Our study shows that microwave power can be used as a knob to tune magnetism and other physical properties to our advantage.</summary>

    <title>Unconventional magnetism in the spin-orbit driven Mott insulators Ba3MIr2O9 (M=Sc,Y)</title>

    <summary>We have carried out detailed bulk and local probe studies on the hexagonal oxides Ba3MIr2O9 (M=Sc,Y) where Ir is expected to have a fractional oxidation state of +4.5. In the structure, Ir-Ir dimers are arranged in an edge shared triangular network parallel to the ab plane. Whereas only weak anomalies are evident in the susceptibility data, clearer anomalies are present in the heat capacity data. Our 45Sc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lineshape (first order quadrupole split) is symmetric at room temperature but becomes progressively asymmetric with decreasing temperatures. This is suggestive of distortions in the structure which could arise from progressive tilt/rotation of the IrO6 octahedra with a decrease in temperature T. The 45Sc NMR spectral weight shifts near the reference frequency with decreasing T indicating the development of magnetic singlet regions. Around 10K, a significant change in the spectrum takes place with a large intensity appearing near the reference frequency but with the spectrum remaining multi-peak. It appears from our 45Sc NMR data that in Ba3ScIr2O9 significant disorder is still present below 10K. In the case of Ba3YIr2O9, the 89Y NMR spectral lines are asymmetric at high temperatures but become nearly symmetric (single magnetic environment) below T~70K. Our 89Y spectra and T1 measurements confirm the onset of long range ordering (LRO) from a bulk of the sample at 4K in this compound. Our results suggest that Ba3YIr2O9 might be structurally distorted at room temperature (via, for example, tilt/rotations of the IrO6 octahedra) but becomes progressively a regular triangular lattice with decreasing T. The effective magnetic moments and magnetic entropy changes are strongly reduced in Ba3YIr2O9 as compared to those expected for a S=1/2 system. Similar effects have been found in other iridates which naturally have strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC).</summary>
