    <summary>We investigate deuteron-triton (DT) fusion in the presence of linearly polarized strong electromagnetic fields in high-frequency limit, in which a complex spherical square-well potential is exploited to describe the nuclear potential. Within the framework of the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation, we have calculated the total and angular differential fusion cross sections by investigating the asymptotical phase shifts of the Coulomb wavefunctions. With introducing a dimensionless quantity of $n_d$ representing the ratio of the particle quiver oscillation amplitude to the radius of nuclear potential, we find that, even though the tunneling probability of passing through the Coulomb repulsive potential keeps almost identical to that in the absence of electromagnetic fields, the peak of total fusion sections shows an apparent shift from the well known value of 110 keV to 78 keV for $n_d=0.01$. The angular differential cross sections also show some resonance peaks that shift from zero inclination angle to $π/2$ with increasing the parameter $n_d$. The corresponding astrophysical $S$-factors are found to be enhanced by several times in amplitudes. With the help of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximate wavefunctions, the shape-resonance tunneling mechanism of the above findings are uncovered and some implications are discussed.</summary>

    <summary>Modification of nuclear reactions due to impurities in plasma is investigated. The hindering effect of Coulomb repulsion between reacting particles, that is effective in direct reactions, can practically disappear if Coulomb interaction of the reacting particles with impurities embedded in plasma is taken into account. The change of the wavefunction of reacting particles in nuclear range due to their Coulomb interaction with impurity is determined using standard time independent perturbation calculation of quantum mechanics. The result can be interpreted as if a slow, quasi-free particle (e.g. a proton) were pushed by a heavy, assisting particle (impurity) of the surroundings and can get (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum which significantly increases the nuclear contact probability density and also the probability of its capture by an other nucleus. As a sample reaction the process, called impurity assisted nuclear $% pd$ reaction is investigated and the rate and power densities produced by the reaction are numerically calculated. With the aid of astrophysical factors the rate and power densities of the impurity assisted $% d(d,n)_{2}^{3}He$, $d(d,p)t$, $d(t,n)_{2}^{4}He$, $_{2}^{3}He(d,p)_{2}^{4}He$% , $_{3}^{6}Li(p,α)_{2}^{3}He$, $_{3}^{7}Li(p,α)_{2}^{4}He$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(p,α)_{3}^{6}Li$, $_{4}^{9}Be(p,d)_{4}^{8}Be$, $%_{4}^{9}Be(α,n)_{6}^{12}C$, $_{5}^{10}B(p,α)_{4}^{7}Be$ and $%_{5}^{11}B(p,α)_{4}^{8}Be$ reactions are also estimated. The affect of plasma-wall interaction on the process is also considered. A partial survey of impurity assisted nuclear reactions which may have practical importance in energy production is also presented.</summary>

    <title>The stopping of swift protons in matter and its implication for astrophysical fusion reactions</title>

    <summary>  The velocity dependence of the stopping power of swift protons and deuterons in low energy collisions is investigated. At low projectile energies the stopping is mainly due to nuclear stopping and charge exchange of the electron. The second mechanism dominates after Ep &gt;=200 eV. A dynamical treatment of the charge exchange mechanism based on two-center electronic wavefunctions yields very transparent results for the exchange probability. We predict that the stopping cross sections vary approximately as v to the 1.35 power for projectile protons on hydrogen targets in the 1 keV energy region.</summary>
