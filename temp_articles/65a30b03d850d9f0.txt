    <summary>A complete model for estimating the electric conductivity of combustion product gases, with added cesium (Cs) or potassium (K) vapor for ionization, is presented. Neutral carrier gases serve as the bulk fluid that carries the seed material, as well as the electrons generated by the partial thermal (equilibrium) ionization of the seed alkali metal. The model accounts for electron-neutral scattering, as well as electron-ion and electron-electron scattering. The model is tested through comparison with published data. The model is aimed at being utilized for the plasma within magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channels, where direct power extraction from passing electrically conducting plasma gas enables electric power generation. The thermal ionization model is then used to estimate the electric conductivity of seeded combustion gases under complete combustion of three selected fuels, namely: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon (C). For each of these three fuels, two options for the oxidizer were applied, namely: air (21 % molecular oxygen, 79 % molecular nitrogen by mole), and pure oxygen (oxy-combustion). Two types of seeds (with 1 % mole fraction, based on the composition before ionization) were also applied for each of the six combinations of (fuel-oxidizer), leading to a total of 12 different MHD plasma cases. For each of these cases, the electric conductivity was computed for a range of temperatures from 2000 K to 3000 K. The smallest estimated electric conductivity was 0.35 S/m for oxy-hydrogen combustion at 2000 K, with potassium seeding. The largest estimated electric conductivity was 180.30 S/m for oxy-carbon combustion at 3000 K, with cesium seeding. At 2000 K, replacing potassium with cesium causes a gain in the electric conductivity by a multiplicative gain factor of about 3.6 regardless of the fuel and oxidizer. This gain factor declines to between 1.77 and 2.07 at 3000 K.</summary>

    <title>Atom-in-jellium equations of state for cryogenic liquids</title>

    <summary>Equations of state (EOS) calculated from a computationally efficient atom-in-jellium treatment of the electronic structure have recently been shown to be consistent with more rigorous path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations of metals in the warm dense matter regime. Here we apply the atom-in-jellium model to predict wide-ranging EOS for the cryogenic liquid elements nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The principal Hugoniots for these substances were surprisingly consistent with available shock data and Thomas-Fermi (TF) EOS for very high pressures, and exhibited systematic variations from TF associated with shell ionization effects, in good agreement with PIMC, though deviating from QMD and experiment in the molecular regime. The new EOS are accurate much higher in pressure than previous widely-used models for nitrogen and oxygen in particular, and should allow much more accurate predictions for oxides and nitrides in the liquid, vapor, and plasma regime, where these have previously been constructed as mixtures containing the older EOS.</summary>

    <summary>The physical mechanisms of periodic separation and relaxation of electric charges within aerosol particles possessing the properties the short-circuited batteries can be extremely diverse. With use of appropriate materials and dispersing methods, the electrochemical, thermoelectric, thermionic, pyroelectric, photoelectric, photo electronic emission, or even radionuclide-based emission micro and nano-batteries can be synthesized and be dispersed in the air as clouds self-assembed of the short-circuited aerosol batteries due to the inter-particle electromagnetic dipole-dipole attraction. Intense thermionic emission from ionized hot spots migrating on the relatively cold surface of charged explosive particles, can convert these particles into short-circuited thermionic batteries, turning an aerosol cloud consisting of such unipolar charged, gradually decomposing explosive particles into ball lightning. The slow exothermic decomposition of the highly sensitive explosive aerosol particles, catalyzed by excess ions on their surface, and also ion-catalyzed reactions of slow water vapor induced oxidation of charged combustible aerosol particles underlie two main classes of natural ball lightning. At the same time, the artificially generated clouds consisting of such unipolar charged aerosol nanobatteries, probably, can have some useful applications, not only military ones. In particular, it seems that high-performance pyroelectric fusion reactors could be created on the basis of such ball-shaped aerosol clouds self-assembled of pyroelectric nanocrystals - short-circuited pyroelectric nanobatteries.</summary>
