    <summary>We present the observation of a complete bandgap and collective spin wave excitation in two-dimensional magnonic crystals comprised of arrays of nanoscale antidots and nanodots, respectively. Considering that the frequencies dealt with here fall in the microwave band, these findings can be used for the development of suitable magnonic metamaterials and spin wave based signal processing. We also present the application of a numerical procedure, to compute the dispersion relations of spin waves for any high symmetry direction in the first Brillouin zone. The results obtained from this procedure has been reproduced and verified by the well established plane wave method for an antidot lattice, when magnetization dynamics at antidot boundaries is pinned. The micromagnetic simulation based method can also be used to obtain iso--frequency countours of spin waves. Iso--frequency contours are analougous of the Fermi surfaces and hence, they have the potential to radicalize our understanding of spin wave dynamics. The physical origin of bands, partial and full magnonic bandgaps has been explained by plotting the spatial distribution of spin wave energy spectral density. Although, unfettered by rigid assumptions and approximations, which afflict most analytical methods used in the study of spin wave dynamics, micromagnetic simulations tend to be computationally demanding. Thus, the observation of collective spin wave excitation in the case of nanodot arrays, which can obviate the need to perform simulations may also prove to be valuable.</summary>

    <summary>In this paper, a magnon-bandgap controllable artificial domain wall waveguide is proposed by means of micromagnetic simulation. By the investigation of the propagation behavior and dispersion relationship of spin waves in artificial domain wall waveguides, it is found that the nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves in the artificial domain walls are mainly affected by the local effective exchange field, and the magnon bandgap can be controlled by changing the maximum value of the effective exchange field. In addition, it is observed that the artificial domain wall waveguides are structurally more stable than the natural domain wall waveguides under the same spin wave injection conditions, and the magnon bandgap of the artificial domain wall waveguides can be adjusted by its width and magnetic anisotropy parameters. The bandgap controllable artificial domain wall scheme is beneficial to the miniaturization and integration of magnon devices and can be applied to future magnonic technology as a novel frequency filter.</summary>

    <title>Exciting high-frequency short-wavelength spin waves using high harmonics of a magnonic cavity mode</title>

    <summary>Confined spin-wave modes are a promising object for studying nonlinear effects and future quantum technologies. Here, using micromagnetic simulations, we use a microwave magnetic field from a coplanar waveguide (CPW) to pump a standing spin-wave confined in the cavity of magnonic crystal. We find that the frequency of the fundamental cavity mode is equal to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the plane film and overlaps with the magnonic bandgap, allowing high magnetic field tunability. Multi-frequency harmonics of the cavity mode are generated once the microwave amplitude surpasses a certain threshold. Specifically, the second and third harmonics at 0.5 T equate to 48.6 and 72.9 GHz with wavelengths of 44 and 22 nm respectively, which propagate into the crystal. This effect reaches saturation when the CPW covers the entire cavity, making the system feasible for realization. These processes show potential for the advancement of magnonics at high-frequencies and very short-wavelengths.</summary>
