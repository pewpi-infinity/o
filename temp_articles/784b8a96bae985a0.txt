    <summary>In this study, a single-phase nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high-entropy alloy (HEA) has been synthesized by mechanical alloying and comprehensively investigated for hydrogen storage responses evaluated in details. High-energy attritor ball mill was used to synthesize the alloy from elemental powder, and hexane medium was used as a process control agent. As synthesized materials was nanocrystalline in nature after 40 h of milling with a lattice parameter of 0.289 nm body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. As synthesized nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA demonstrated remarkable hydrogen storage properties, absorbing 2.1 wt.% of hydrogen in 3 minutes at 300°C with 50 atm of hydrogen pressure. At the same temperature, it also desorbed about 1.6 wt.% of hydrogen in 6 minutes. These quick rates of absorption and desorption demonstrate how well the alloy absorbs and releases hydrogen. Additionally, the alloy showed outstanding cyclic stability, retaining almost all of its hydrogen capacity across 25 cycles with only a slight 0.2 wt.% loss. The nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA is a potential option for hydrogen storage applications due to its outstanding cycle stability and fast kinetics of hydrogen storage and release.</summary>

    <summary>An effective method for increasing the electrocatalytic activity of metallic glasses (MGs) in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. This method applies a noble metal hybridization strategy to design a highly reactive catalyst for alkaline HER based on MGs with a nano-porous structure. The porous structure provides an abundance of active sites and exposes a large specific surface area to the electrolyte, thus effectively improving the activity of the HER catalysts. The doping of Au element can create electronic defects, adjust the electronic structure, change the electronic interaction, introduce lattice distortion, regulate mixing entropy, and improve the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. All these properties make np-AlMnYNiCoAu catalyst a potential electrode for alkaline HER. Significantly, we find that the high mixing entropy can enhance the HER performances. The present work could lead to a new approach to further develop environmentally friendly amorphous electrocatalyst with high efficiency and excellent stability for HER in alkaline solution.</summary>

    <title>Exact Results for the Residual Entropy of Ice Hexagonal Monolayer</title>

    <summary>Since the problem of the residual entropy of square ice was exactly solved, exact solutions for two-dimensional realistic ice models have been of interest. In this paper, we study the exact residual entropy of ice hexagonal monolayer in two cases. In the case that the external electric field along the z-axis exists, we map the hydrogen configurations into the spin configurations of the Ising model on the Kagomé lattice. By taking the low temperature limit of the Ising model, we derive the exact residual entropy, which agrees with the result determined previously from the dimer model on the honeycomb lattice. In another case that the ice hexagonal monolayer is under the periodic boundary conditions in the cubic ice lattice, we employ the six-vertex model on the square lattice to represent the hydrogen configurations obeying the ice rules. The exact residual entropy in this case is obtained from the solution of the equivalent six-vertex model. Our work provides more examples of the exactly soluble two-dimensional models.</summary>
