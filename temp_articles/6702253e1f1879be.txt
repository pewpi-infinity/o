    <summary>Muon catalyzed fusion ($μ$CF) has recently regained considerable research interest owing to several new developments and applications. In this regard, we have performed a comprehensive study of the most important fusion reaction, namely $(dtμ)_{J=v=0}\toα$+$n$+$μ$+17.6 MeV or $(αμ)_{nl}$+$n$+17.6 MeV. The coupled-channels Schrödinger equation for the reaction is thus solved, satisfying the boundary condition for the muonic molecule $(dtμ)_{\rm J=v=0}$ as the initial state and the outgoing $αn μ$ channel with the $α$-$n$ $D$ wave. We employ the $dtμ$- and $αn μ$-channel coupled three-body model. All the $d$-$t$ and $α$-$n$ potentials, and the $d t$-$αn$ channel-coupling nonlocal tensor potential are chosen to reproduce the observed low-energy astrophysical $S$-factor of the reaction $d$+$t\toα$+$n$+17.6 MeV, as well as the total cross section of the $α$+$n$ reaction. The resultant $dtμ$ fusion rate is 1.15x10$^{12}$ s$^{-1}$. Substituting the obtained total wave function into the $T$ matrix, we have calculated absolute values of the fusion rates going to the bound and continuum states of the outgoing $α$-$μ$ pair. We then derived the initial $α$-$μ$ sticking probability $ω_S^0$=0.857%, which is $\sim$7% smaller than the literature values ($\simeq$0.91-0.93%), and can explain the recent observations (2001) at high D-T densities. We also calculate the absolute values for the momentum and energy spectra of the emitted muon. The most important result is that the peak energy is 1.1 keV although the mean energy is 9.5 keV. This is an essential result for the ongoing experimental project to realize the generation of an ultra-slow negative muon beam by utilizing the $μ$CF for various applications e.g., a scanning negative muon microscope and an injection source for the muon collider.</summary>

    <title>The effect of initial fluctuations on bottomonia suppression in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

    <summary>Using the screened Cornell potential and the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD to determine, respectively, the properties of bottomonia and their dissociation cross sections in a quark-gluon plasma, we study in a 2+1 ideal hydrodynamics the effect of initial fluctuations on bottomonia production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We find that while initial fluctuations hardly affect the yield of the 1S ground state bottomonium, their effect on that of excited bottomonium states is not small. Compared to the case with smooth initial conditions, the survival probability of excited bottomonia is reduced at low transverse momentum and increased at high transverse momentum. The observed suppression of the excited bottomonia relative to the ground state bottomonium by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaborations at an average transverse momentum can, however, be described at present with both smooth and fluctuating initial conditions.</summary>

    <title>Propagation of Neutrinos through Magnetized Gamma-Ray Burst Fireball</title>

    <summary>  The neutrino self-energy is calculated in a weakly magnetized plasma consists of electrons, protons, neutrons and their anti-particles and using this we have calculated the neutrino effective potential up to order $M^{-4}_W$. In the absence of magnetic field it reduces to the known result. We have also calculated explicitly the effective potentials for different backgrounds which may be helpful in different environments. By considering the mixing of three active neutrinos in the medium with the magnetic field we have derived the survival and conversion probabilities of neutrinos from one flavor to another and also the resonance condition is derived. As an application of the above, we considered the dense and relativistic plasma of the Gamma-Ray Bursts fireball through which neutrinos of 5-30 MeV can propagate and depending on the fireball parameters they may oscillate resonantly or non-resonantly from one flavor to another. These MeV neutrinos are produced due to stellar collapse or merger events which trigger the Gamma-Ray Burst. The fireball itself also produces MeV neutrinos due to electron positron annihilation, inverse beta decay and nucleonic bremsstrahlung. Using the three neutrino mixing and considering the best fit values of the neutrino parameters, we found that electron neutrinos are hard to oscillate to another flavors. On the other hand, the muon neutrinos and the tau neutrinos oscillate with equal probability to one another, which depends on the neutrino energy, temperature and size of the fireball. Comparison of oscillation probabilities with and without magnetic field shows that, they depend on the neutrino energy and also on the size of the fireball. By using the resonance condition, we have also estimated the resonance length of the propagating neutrinos as well as the baryon content of the fireball.</summary>
