    <summary>  A practical method for finding free energy barriers for transitions in high-dimensional classical and quantum systems is presented and used to calculate the dissociative sticking probability of H2 on a metal surface within transition state theory (TST). The reversible work involved in shifting the system confined to a hyperplane from the reactant region towards products is evaluated directly. Quantum mechanical degrees of freedom are included by using Feynman Path Integrals with the hyperplane constraint applied to the centroid of the cyclic paths. An optimal dividing surface for the rate estimated by TST is identified naturally in the course of the reversible work evaluation. The free energy barrier is determined relative to the reactant state directly, so an estimate of the transition rate can be obtained without requiring a solvable reference model for the transition state. The method has been applied to calculations of the sticking probability of a thermalized hydrogen gas on a Cu(110) surface. The two hydrogen atoms were included quantum mechanically, and over two hundred atoms in the Cu crystal where included classically. The activation energy for adsorption and desorption was determined and found to be significantly lowered by tunneling at low temperature. The calculated values agree quite well with experimental estimates. Dynamical corrections to the classical TST rate estimate were evaluated and found to be small.</summary>

    <title>Reply to Comment on "Does the Equivalence between Gravitational Mass and Energy Survive for a Composite Quantum Body?"</title>

    <summary>We have recently shown that both passive and active gravitational masses of a composite body are not equivalent to its energy due to some quantum effects. We have also suggested an idealized and more realistic experiments to detect the above mentioned inequivalence for a passive gravitational mass. The suggested idealized effect is as follows. A spacecraft moves protons of a macroscopic ensemble of hydrogen atoms with constant velocity in the Earth's gravitational field. Due to non-homogeneous squeezing of space by the field, electron ground state wave function experiences time-dependent perturbation in each hydrogen atom. This perturbation results in the appearance of a finite probability for an electron to be excited at higher energy levels and to emit a photon. The experimental task is to detect such photons from the ensemble of the atoms. More realistic variants of such experiment can be realized in solid crystals and nuclei, as first mentioned by us. In his recent Comment on our paper, Crowell has argued that the effect, suggested by us, contradicts the existing experiments and, in particular, astronomic data. We show here that this conclusion is incorrect and based on the so-called "free fall" experiments, where our effect does not have to be observed.</summary>

    <title>Neutron scattering studies of K$_3$H(SO$_4)_2$ and K$_3$D(SO$_4)_2$: The particle-in-a-box model for the quantum phase transition</title>

    <summary>In the crystal of K$_3$H(SO$_4)_2$, or K$_3$D(SO$_4)_2$, dimers (SO$_4)...$H$...$(SO$_4)$, or (SO$_4)...$D$...$(SO$_4)$, are linked by strong centrosymmetric hydrogen or deuterium bonds whose O$...$O length is $\approx 2.50$ Å. We address two open questions. (i) Are H or D sites split or not? (ii) Is there any structural counterpart to the phase transition observed for K$_3$D(SO$_4)_2$ at $T_c \approx 85.5$ K, that does not exist for K$_3$H(SO$_4)_2$. Neutron diffraction by single-crystals at cryogenic or room temperature reveals no structural transition and no resolvable splitting of H or D sites. However, the width of the probability densities suggest unresolved splitting of the wavefunctions suggesting rigid entities H$_{L1/2}-$H$_{R1/2}$ or D$_{L1/2}-$D$_{R1/2}$ whose separation lengths are $l_\mathrm{H} \approx 0.16$ Å\ or $l_\mathrm{D} \approx 0.25$ Å. The vibrational eigenstates for the center of mass of H$_{L1/2}-$H$_{R1/2}$ revealed by inelastic neutron scattering are amenable to a square-well and we suppose the same potential holds for D$_{L1/2}-$D$_{R1/2}$. In order to explain dielectric and calorimetric measurements of mixed crystals K$_3$D$_{(1-ρ)}$H$_ρ$(SO$_4)_2$ ($0 \le ρ\le 1$), we replace the classical notion of order-disorder by the quantum notion of discernible (eg D$_{L1/2}-$D$_{R1/2}$) or indiscernible (eg H$_{L1/2}-$H$_{R1/2}$) components depending on the separation length of the split wavefunction. The discernible-indiscernible isostructural transition at finite temperatures is induced by a thermal pure quantum state or at 0 K by $ρ$.</summary>
