    <title>On the possible new 750 GeV heavy boson resonance at the LHC</title>

    <summary>We argue that the possible new heavy boson resonance of 750 GeV is an ideal candidate as a twin particle of the 125 GeV scalar boson, both emerging from the large mixing of the scalar toponium and scalar gluonium. The twin pseudoscalar particles are expected to have smaller masses. The discovery of the 750 GeV resonance is possible only with a much more data than for the 125 GeV resonance since only the gluonium component is detectable above the toponium threshold. The similar type of the QCD resonances is expected in the bottomonium-gluonium system. If the LHC will discover all these heavy quarkonium-gluonium resonances, the absence of the Higgs scalar should not be considered an obstacle because the nonsingular theory with the UV cutoff fixed by the weak boson masses is superior to the Standard Model. Namely, it solves the basic problems for the SM such as: (1) the existence of light neutrinos, (2) dark matter particles to be the heavy Majorana neutrinos and (3) broken lepton and baryon numbers.</summary>

    <summary>Detecting TeV--PeV cosmic neutrinos provides crucial tests of neutrino physics and astrophysics. The statistics of IceCube and the larger proposed IceCube-Gen2 demand calculations of neutrino-nucleus interactions subdominant to deep-inelastic scattering, which is mediated by weak-boson couplings to nuclei. The largest such interactions are W-boson and trident production, which are mediated instead through photon couplings to nuclei. In a companion paper [1], we make the most comprehensive and precise calculations of those interactions at high energies. In this paper, we study their phenomenological consequences. We find that: (1) These interactions are dominated by the production of on-shell W-bosons, which carry most of the neutrino energy, (2) The cross section on water/iron can be as large as 7.5%/14% that of charged-current deep-inelastic scattering, much larger than the quoted uncertainty on the latter, (3) Attenuation in Earth is increased by as much as 15%, (4) W-boson production on nuclei exceeds that through the Glashow resonance on electrons by a factor of $\simeq$ 20 for the best-fit IceCube spectrum, (5) The primary signals are showers that will significantly affect the detection rate in IceCube-Gen2; a small fraction of events give unique signatures that may be detected sooner.</summary>

    <title>Refractive neutrino masses, ultralight dark matter and cosmology</title>

    <summary>We consider in detail a possibility that the observed neutrino oscillations are due to refraction on ultralight scalar boson dark matter. We introduce the refractive mass squared, $\tilde{m}^2$, and study its properties: dependence on neutrino energy, state of the background, etc. If the background is in a state of cold gas of particles, $\tilde{m}^2$ shows a resonance dependence on energy. Above the resonance ($E \gg E_R $), we find that $\tilde{m}^2$ has the same properties as usual vacuum mass squared. Below the resonance, $\tilde{m}^2$ decreases with energy, which (if realised) allows us to avoid the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino masses. Also, $\tilde{m}^2$ may depend on time. We consider the validity of the results: effects of multiple interactions with scalars, and modification of the dispersion relation. We show that for values of parameters of the system required to reproduce the observed neutrino masses, perturbativity is broken at low energies, which border above the resonance. If the background is in the state of coherent classical field, the refractive mass does not depend on energy explicitly but may show time dependence. It coincides with the refractive mass in a cold gas at high energies. The refractive nature of neutrino mass can be tested by searches of its dependence on energy and time.</summary>
