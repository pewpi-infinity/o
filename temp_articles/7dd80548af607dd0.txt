    <summary>Muon collider is a considerable candidate of the next-generation high-energy lepton collider machine. Operating an RF cavity in a multi-Tesla magnet is a critical requirement in a muon accelerator and a cooling channel. However, the maximum RF gradient in a vacuum RF cavity is strongly limited by an external magnetic field. Dense hydrogen gas filled RF cavity has been proposed since it is functional of generating a high RF accelerating gradient in a strong magnetic field and making an ionization cooling process at the same time. A critical issue of the cavity is a beam- induced plasma that consumes a considerable amount of RF power. The gas filled RF test cell was made and measured the RF loading due to a beam-induced plasma by using an intense proton beam at Fermilab. By doping an electronegative gas in dense hydrogen, the plasma loading effect is significantly mitigated. The result shows that the cavity is functional with a muon collider beam. Recent progress is shown in this presentation.</summary>

    <title>Physics of high-intensity high-energy particle beam propagation in open air and outer-space plasmas</title>

    <summary>  This report is a self-contained and comprehensive review of the physics of propagating pulses of high-intensity high-energy particle beams in pre-existing or self-generated plasmas. Consideration is given to beams of electrons, protons, muons, and their antiparticles, as well as to neutral-hydrogen, positronium, and electron-positron-plasmoid beams. The first part is a systematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation, plasma self-generation, energy/current-losses, and stability of such pulses. The second part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have been carried out, in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas, to assess the validity of theoretical models. It is found that the data available on these experiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with theory. In particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current charged-particle beams in the atmosphere is possible over distances equal to several Nordsieck lengths. In order not to be deflected by Earth's magnetic field, electron-beam pulses need to be guided by a pre-formed channel, while proton-beam pulses may under suitable conditions propagate undeflected through both the low- and high-atmosphere. In ionospheric or outer-space plasmas, very-long-range propagation across Earth's magnetic field requires GeV to TeV electrons or positron beams in order for the transverse deflection to be acceptable, while undeflected propagation is possible for plasmoid beams consisting of co-moving high-energy particle pairs such as electrons and positrons.</summary>

    <summary>Processes occurring in a radio-frequency (rf) cavity, filled with high pressure gas and interacting with proton beams, have been studied via advanced numerical simulations. Simulations support the experimental program on the hydrogen gas-filled rf cavity in the Mucool Test Area (MTA) at Fermilab, and broader research on the design of muon cooling devices. SPACE, a 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code with atomic physics support, was used in simulation studies. Plasma dynamics in the rf cavity, including the process of neutral gas ionization by proton beams, plasma loading of the rf cavity, and atomic processes in plasma such as electron-ion and ion-ion recombination and electron attachment to dopant molecules, have been studied. Through comparison with experiments in the MTA, simulations quantified several uncertain values of plasma properties such as effective recombination rates and the attachment time of electrons to dopant molecules. Simulations have achieved very good agreement with experiments on plasma loading and related processes. The experimentally validated code SPACE is capable of predictive simulations of muon cooling devices.</summary>
