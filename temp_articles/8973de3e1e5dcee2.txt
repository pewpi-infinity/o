    <summary>The temperature dependence of rates of electron impact ionization and two electrons recombination are calculated using Wannier cross section of electron impact ionization of neutral hydrogen atom. Entropy production and power dissipation are derived for the case when the ionization degree deviates from its equilibrium value. This is the special case of the obtained general formula for entropy production accompanying chemical reactions. Damping rate of the sound waves is calculated and the conditions when ionization processes dominate are considered. A quasi-classical approximation for the heating mechanism of solar chromosphere is proposed. Several analogous phenomena for damping rates in liquids and crystals are shortly discussed, for example, deaf sound of a glass of beer or English salt solution. An explicit expression for the second or bulk (or volume) viscosity of hydrogen plasma is calculated from firsts principles. For the first time some second viscosity is calculated from first principles.</summary>

    <title>Metallization of hydrogen by intercalating ammonium ions in metal fcc lattices at low pressure</title>

    <summary>Metallic hydrogen is capable of showing room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental syntheses are extremely hard. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the synthesis pressure of metallic hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization of hydrogen by "chemical precompression" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still requires relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve high-temperature superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting ammonium ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the periodic table reveal 12 elements which can form kinetically stable and superconducting hydrides at low pressures, where the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up to 118.40, 105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to atomic H, facilitating metallization of hydrogen under mild pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships, one is the H-atom charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first ionization energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature. Besides, ZnN2H8, CdN2H8, and HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure, and the presence of interstitial electrons suggests that they are also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78, and 3.05 eV) imply that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.</summary>

    <title>Cooling sequences and color-magnitude diagrams for cool white dwarfs with hydrogen-atmospheres</title>

    <summary>  We present new cooling sequences, color-magnitude diagrams, and color-color diagrams for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres down to an effective temperature $\te=1500$ K. We include a more detailed treatment of the physics of the fully-ionized interior, particularly an improved discussion of the thermodynamics of the temperature-dependent ion-ion and ion-electron contributions of the quantum, relativistic electron-ion plasma. The present calculations also incorporate accurate boundary conditions between the degenerate core and the outermost layers as well as updated atmosphere models including the H$_2$-H$_2$ induced-dipole absorption. We examine the differences on the cooling time of the star arising from uncertainties in the initial carbon-oxygen profile and the core-envelope $L$-$T_c$ relation. The maximum time delay due to crystallization-induced chemical fractionation remains substantial, from $\sim 1.0$ Gyr for 0.5 and 1.2 $\msol$ white dwarfs to $\sim 1.5$ Gyr for 0.6 to 0.8 $\msol$ white dwarfs, even with initial stratified composition profiles, and cannot be ignored in detailed white dwarf cooling calculations. These cooling sequences provide theoretical support to search for or identify old disk or halo hydrogen-rich white dwarfs by characterizing their mass and age from their observational signatures.</summary>
