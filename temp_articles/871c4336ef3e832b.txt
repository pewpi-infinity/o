    <summary>Recently synthesized two-dimensional graphene-like material referred to as graphenylene is a semiconductor with a narrow direct bandgap that holds great promise for nanoelectronic applications. The significant bandgap increase can be provided by the strain applied to graphenylene crystal lattice or by using nanoribbons instead of extended layers. In this paper, we present the systematic study of the electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of graphenylene nanoribbons using calculations based on the density functional theory. Estimating the binding energies, we substantiate the stability of nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair edges passivated by hydrogen atoms. Electronic spectra indicate that all considered structures could be classified as direct bandgap semiconductors. The absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, and complex refractive index are calculated by means of the first-principles methods and the Kubo-Greenwood formula. It has been shown that graphenylene ribbons effectively absorb visible-range electromagnetic waves. Due to this absorption, the conductivity is noticeably increased in this range. The transport coefficients and thermoelectric figure of merit are calculated by the nonequilibrium Green functions method. Summarizing the results, we discuss the possible use of graphenylene films and nanoribbons in nanoelectronic devices.</summary>

    <summary>Stanene, a two-dimensional counterpart to graphene, has the potential to exhibit novel quantum phenomena when grown on a magnetic topological insulator (MTI). This work demonstrates the formation of up to bilayer stanene on 30\% Sb-doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_4$ (MBST), a well known MTI, albeit with a buffer layer (BL) in between. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), when combined with density functional theory (DFT), reveals stanene related bands such as two hole-like bands and an inverted parabolic band around the $\overlineΓ$ point. An outer hole-like band traverses the Fermi level (\ef) and gives rise to a hexagonal Fermi surface, showing that stanene on MBST is metallic. In contrast, a bandgap of 0.8 eV is observed at the $\overline{K}$ point. We find that DFT shows good agreement with ARPES only when the BL and hydrogen passivation of the top Sn layer are considered in the calculation. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) establishes the honeycomb buckled structure of stanene. A stanene-related component is also detected in the Sn $d$ core level spectra, in addition to a BL-related component. The BL, which forms because of the chemical bonding between Sn and the top two layers of MBST, has an ordered crystal lattice with random anti-site defects. The composition of the BL is estimated to be Sn:Te:Bi/Sb $\approx$ 2:1:1 from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Low energy electron diffraction shows that the lattice constant of stanene is marginally larger than that of MBST, and the STM result aligns with this. The BL bridges this disparity and provides a platform for stanene growth.</summary>
