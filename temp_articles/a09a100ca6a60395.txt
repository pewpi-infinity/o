    <summary>Boson stars are often described as macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensates. By accommodating large numbers of bosons in the same quantum state, they materialize macroscopically the intangible probability density cloud of a single particle in the quantum world. We take this interpretation of boson stars one step further. We show, by explicitly constructing the fully non-linear solutions, that static (in terms of their spacetime metric, $g_{μν}$) boson stars, composed of a single complex scalar field, $Φ$, can have a non-trivial multipolar structure, yielding the same morphologies for their energy density as those that elementary hydrogen atomic orbitals have for their probability density. This provides a close analogy between the elementary solutions of the non-linear Einstein--Klein-Gordon theory, denoted $Φ_{(N,\ell,m)}$, which could be realized in the macrocosmos, and those of the linear Schrödinger equation in a Coulomb potential, denoted $Ψ_{(N,\ell,m)}$, that describe the microcosmos. In both cases, the solutions are classified by a triplet of quantum numbers $(N,\ell,m)$. In the gravitational theory, multipolar boson stars can be interpreted as individual bosonic lumps in equilibrium; remarkably, the (generic) solutions with $m\neq 0$ describe gravitating solitons $[g_{μν},Φ_{(N,\ell,m)}]$ without any continuous symmetries. Multipolar boson stars analogue to hybrid orbitals are also constructed.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity and Disorder in High-Tc Materials: Crystalline Copper Oxides and Liquid Metallic Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>

    <title>Models of the Muonium to Antimuonium Transition</title>

    <summary>Muonium is a bound state composed of an antimuon and an electron, and it constitutes a hydrogen-like atom. Because of the absence of the hadronic matter in the bound state, the muonium is a useful probe to explore new physics being free from the hadronic uncertainties. The process of the muonium-to-antimuonium transition is considered to be effective to identify fundamental interactions which relate to the lepton flavor and lepton number violation. New experiments are being planned at J-PARC in Japan and CSNS in China, and it is expected to attract more attention in the near future. In this paper, we will study what kind of model can be verified in the next generation of the muonium-to-antimuonium transition search experiments while escaping the limitations from other experiments. Though the transition probability is strongly suppressed by the lepton flavor conservation in the standard model, it can be much larger by the exchanges of neutral and doubly charged bosons, and by box loop diagrams in new physics beyond the standard model. We study the neutrino models with heavy Majorana neutrinos at TeV scale, a type-II seesaw model, left--right models, and models for radiative neutrino masses such as the Zee-Babu model in particular, in addition to other possible models to induce the sizable transition probability, which can be tested in the forthcoming experiments.</summary>
