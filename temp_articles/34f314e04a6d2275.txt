    <summary>We first show a possible mechanism to create a new type of nuclear fusion, thermal resonance fusion, i.e. low energy nuclear fusion with thermal resonance of light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium or tritium. The fusion of two light nuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up to the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be realized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light atoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal resonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of the deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion mechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how these light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of metal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal vibrations and resonances at different modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect at different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates the thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect, is possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very sharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for thermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or make the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable compound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the penetrating probability larger than 10^{-10}.</summary>

    <summary>We investigate deuteron-triton (DT) fusion in the presence of linearly polarized strong electromagnetic fields in high-frequency limit, in which a complex spherical square-well potential is exploited to describe the nuclear potential. Within the framework of the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation, we have calculated the total and angular differential fusion cross sections by investigating the asymptotical phase shifts of the Coulomb wavefunctions. With introducing a dimensionless quantity of $n_d$ representing the ratio of the particle quiver oscillation amplitude to the radius of nuclear potential, we find that, even though the tunneling probability of passing through the Coulomb repulsive potential keeps almost identical to that in the absence of electromagnetic fields, the peak of total fusion sections shows an apparent shift from the well known value of 110 keV to 78 keV for $n_d=0.01$. The angular differential cross sections also show some resonance peaks that shift from zero inclination angle to $π/2$ with increasing the parameter $n_d$. The corresponding astrophysical $S$-factors are found to be enhanced by several times in amplitudes. With the help of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximate wavefunctions, the shape-resonance tunneling mechanism of the above findings are uncovered and some implications are discussed.</summary>

    <title>Importance of lifetime effects in breakup and suppression of complete fusion in reactions of weakly bound nuclei</title>

    <summary>Complete fusion cross sections in collisions of light, weakly bound nuclei and high Z targets show above-barrier suppression of complete fusion. This has been interpreted as resulting from breakup of the weakly bound nucleus prior to reaching the fusion barrier, reducing the probability of complete fusion. This paper investigates how these conclusions are affected by lifetimes of the resonant states that are populated prior to breakup. If the mean life of a populated resonance is much longer than the fusion timescale, then its breakup cannot suppress complete fusion. For short-lived resonances, the situation is more complex. This work includes the mean life of the short-lived 2+ resonance in 8Be in classical dynamical model calculations to determine its effect on energy and angular correlations of the breakup fragments and on predictions of fusion suppression. Coincidence measurements of breakup fragments produced in reactions of 9Be with 144Sm, 168Er, 186W, 196Pt, 208Pb and 209Bi at energies below the barrier are re-analysed. Predictions of breakup observables and of complete and incomplete fusion at energies above the fusion barrier are made using the classical dynamical simulation code PLATYPUS, modified to include the lifetimes of short-lived resonant states. The agreement of the breakup observables is improved when lifetime effects are included. The predicted suppression of complete fusion due to breakup is nearly independent of Z, with an average value of 9%, below the experimentally determined fusion suppression of 30% in these systems. This more realistic treatment of breakup leads to the conclusion that the suppression of complete fusion cannot be fully explained by breakup prior to reaching the fusion barrier. Other mechanisms that can suppress complete fusion must be investigated. A candidate is cluster transfer that produces the same nuclei as incomplete fusion.</summary>
