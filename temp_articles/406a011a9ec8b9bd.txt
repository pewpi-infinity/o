    <summary>Based on the Chetaev theorem on stable dynamical trajectories in the presence of dissipative forces, we obtain the generalized condition for stability of relativistic classical Hamiltonian systems (with an invariant evolution parameter) in the form of the Stueckelberg equation. As is known, this equation is the basis of a competing paradigm known as parametrized relativistic quantum mechanics (pRQM). It is shown that the energy of dissipative forces, which generate the Chetaev generalized condition of stability, coincides exactly with Bohmian relativistic quantum potential. We show that the squared amplitude of a wave function in the Stueckelberg equation is equivalent to the probability density function for the number of particle trajectories, relative to which the velocity and the position of the particle are not hidden parameters.
  The conditions for reasonableness of trajectory interpretation of pRQM are discussed. On basis of analysis of a general formalism for vacuum-flavor mixing of neutrino within the context of the standard and pRQM models we show that the corresponding expressions for the probability of transition from one neutrino flavor to another differ appreciably, but they are experimentally testable: the estimations of absolute value for neutrino mass based on modern experimental data for solar and atmospheric neutrinos show that the pRQM results have a preference. It is noted that the selection criterion of mass solutions relies on proximity between the average size of condensed neutrino clouds, which is described by the Muraki formula (29th ICRC, 2005) and depends on the neutrino mass, and the average size of typical observed void structure (dark matter + hydrogen gas), which plays the role of characteristic dimension of large-scale structure of the Universe.</summary>

    <title>Handshake electron transfer from hydrogen Rydberg atoms incident at a series of metallic thin films</title>

    <summary>Thin metallic films have a 1D quantum well along the surface normal direction, which yields particle-in-a-box style electronic quantum states. However the quantum well is not infinitely deep and the wavefunctions of these states penetrate outside the surface where the electron is bound by its own image-charge attraction. Therefore a series of discrete, vacant states reach out from the thin film into the vacuum increasing the probability of electron transfer from an external atom or molecule to the thin film, especially for the resonant case where the quantum well energy matches that of the Rydberg atom.
  We show that `handshake' electron transfer from a highly excited Rydberg atom to these thin-film states is experimentally measurable. Thicker films, have a wider 1D box, changing the energetic distribution and image-state contribution to the thin film wavefunctions, resulting in more resonances. Calculations successfully predict the number of resonances and the nature of the thin-film wavefunctions for a given film thickness.</summary>

    <title>An angular momentum based graviton detector</title>

    <summary>We show that gravitons with energy $E&lt;Ω$, where $Ω$ is the energy gap a localized non-relativistic system, can be detected by finite-time interactions with a detector. Our detector is based on a quadrupole moment interaction between the hydrogen atom and the gravitational field in the linearized approximation. In this model, the external agent responsible for switching the interaction on an off inputs energy into the system, which creates a non-zero excitation probability even when the field is in the vacuum state. However, when the gravitational field is in a one-particle state with angular momentum, we obtain excitations due to the field's particle content. These detector excitations are then associated with the detection of gravitons. We also discuss a possible physical realization of our model where the electromagnetic field plays the role of the external agent.</summary>
