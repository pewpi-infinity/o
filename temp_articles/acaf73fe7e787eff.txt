    <summary>Single electron sources enable electron quantum optics experiments where single electrons emitted in a ballistic electronic interferometer plays the role of a single photons emitted in an optical medium in Quantum Optics. A qualitative step has been made with the recent generation of single charge levitons obtained by applying Lorentzian voltage pulse on the contact of the quantum conductor. Simple to realize and operate, the source emits electrons in the form of striking minimal excitation states called levitons. We review the striking properties of levitons and their possible applications in quantum physics to electron interferometry and entanglement. W Schematic generation of time resolved single charges called levitons using Lorentzian voltage pulses applied on a contact. A Quantum Point Contact is used to partition the levitons for further analysis. Injecting levitons on opposite contacts with a delay $\τ$ enables to probe electronic like Hong Ou Mandel correlations. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Single electron sources In this introduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single electrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where the goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a conductor with good accuracy to realize a quantized current source whose current I = ef shows metrological accuracy. The latter, the coherent single electrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose wave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron coherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic beam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic Mach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the injected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The frequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current accuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron transfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for current standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the early 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a submicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers.

    <summary>Although quantum computation (QC) is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot provide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers.</summary>

    <summary>Superconducting qubits are a promising route to achieving large-scale quantum computers. A key challenge in realising large-scale superconducting quantum processors involves mitigating frequency collisions. In this paper, we present an approach to tuning fixed-frequency qubits with the use of an electron beam to locally anneal the Josephson junction. We demonstrate the ability to both increase and decrease the junction barrier resistance. The technique shows an improvement in wafer scale frequency targetting by assessing the frequency collisions in our qubit architecture. Coherence measurements are also done to evaluate the performance before and after tuning. The tuning process utilises a standard electron beam lithography system, ensuring reproducibility and implementation by any group capable of fabricating these Josephson junctions. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computing systems, thereby paving the way for the future of quantum computing.</summary>
