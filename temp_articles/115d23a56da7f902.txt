    <summary>The charmonium and bottomonium mass spectra are investigated in potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) with the heavy quark potential computed by lattice QCD simulations. The potential consists of a static potential and relativistic corrections classified in powers of the inverse of heavy quark mass m, and the effects of the O(1/m) and O(1/m^{2}) spin-orbit corrections on the mass spectra are examined systematically. The pattern of the mass spectra is found to be in fairly good agreement with experimental data, in which the O(1/m) correction gives an important contribution.</summary>

    <summary>Study of the hadronic matrix elements can provide not only tests of the QCD sector of the Standard Model (in comparing with existing experiments) but also reliable low-energy hadronic quantities applicable to a wide range of beyond-the-Standard Model scenarios where experiments or theoretical calculations are limited or difficult. On the QCD side, progress has been made in the notoriously difficult problem of addressing gluonic structure inside the nucleon, reaching higher-$Q^2$ region of the form factors, and providing a complete picture of the proton spin. However, even further study and improvement of systematic uncertainties are needed. There are also proposed calculations of higher-order operators in the neutron electric dipole moment Lagrangian, which would be useful when combined with effective theory to probe BSM. Lattice isovector tensor and scalar charges can be combined with upcoming neutron beta-decay measurements of the Fierz interference term and neutrino asymmetry parameter to probe new interactions in the effective theory, revealing the scale of potential new TeV particles. Finally, I revisit the systematic uncertainties in recent calculations of $g_A$ and review prospects for future calculations.</summary>

    <title>Effective string description of the interquark potential in the 3D U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>

    <summary>The U(1) lattice gauge theory in three dimensions is a perfect laboratory to study the properties of the confining string. On the one hand, thanks to the mapping to a Coulomb gas of monopoles, the confining properties of the model can be studied semi-classically. On the other hand, high-precision numerical estimates of Polyakov loop correlators can be obtained via a duality map to a spin model. This allowed us to perform high-precision tests of the universal behavior of the effective string and to find macroscopic deviations with respect to the expected Nambu-Goto predictions. These corrections could be fitted with very good precision including a contribution (which is consistent with Lorentz symmetry) proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature in the effective string action, as originally suggested by Polyakov. Performing our analysis at different values of $β$ we were able to show that this term scales as expected by Polyakov's solution and dominates in the continuum. We also discuss the interplay between the extrinsic curvature contribution and the boundary correction induced by the Polyakov loops.</summary>
