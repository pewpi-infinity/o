    <summary>As demonstrated by Chernodub, vacuum in a strong magnetic field behaves as a periodic Abrikosov vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor. We investigate electromagnetic behavior of vacuum in this state. Since superconductivity is realized along the axis of magnetic field only, strong anisotropy of the vacuum dielectric tensor is observed. The diagonal components of the tensor are positive in the x and y directions perpendicular to the magnetic field, and negative in the z direction along the field. As a result, vacuum behaves as a hyperbolic metamaterial medium. If the magnetic field is constant, low frequency extraordinary photons experience this medium as a (3+1) Minkowski spacetime in which the role of time is played by the spatial z coordinate. Spatial variations of the magnetic field curve this effective spacetime, and may lead to formation of "event horizons", which are analogous to electromagnetic black holes in hyperbolic metamaterials. We also note that hyperbolic metamaterials behave as diffractionless "perfect lenses". Since large enough magnetic fields probably had arisen in the course of evolution of early Universe, the demonstrated hyperbolic behavior of early vacuum may have imprints in the large scale structure of the present-day Universe.</summary>

    <summary>The photon blockade breakdown in a continuously driven cavity QED system has been proposed as a prime example for a first-order driven-dissipative quantum phase transition. But the predicted scaling from a microscopic system - dominated by quantum fluctuations - to a macroscopic one - characterized by stable phases - and the associated exponents and phase diagram have not been observed so far. In this work we couple a single transmon qubit with a fixed coupling strength $g$ to an in-situ bandwidth $κ$ tuneable superconducting cavity to controllably approach this thermodynamic limit. Even though the system remains microscopic, we observe its behavior to become more and more macroscopic as a function of $g/κ$. For the highest realized $g/κ\approx 287$ the system switches with a characteristic dwell time as high as 6 seconds between a bright coherent state with $\approx 8 \times 10^3$ intra-cavity photons and the vacuum state with equal probability. This exceeds the microscopic time scales by six orders of magnitude and approaches the near perfect hysteresis expected between two macroscopic attractors in the thermodynamic limit. These findings and interpretation are qualitatively supported by semi-classical theory and large-scale Quantum-Jump Monte Carlo simulations. Besides shedding more light on driven-dissipative physics in the limit of strong light-matter coupling, this system might also find applications in quantum sensing and metrology.</summary>

    <title>Theory of superconductivity of gravitation and the dark matter enigma</title>

    <summary>In this article, the question of the nature of cold dark matter is approached from a new angle. By invoking the Cauchy problem of relativity it is shown how, under very precise astrophysical conditions, the Einstein general theory of relativity is formally equivalent to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. This fact lead us to suspect that the superconductivity of gravitation ought to be a real physical process occurring in the outskirts of galaxies. It is found that quantum mechanically gravity can achieve a type-II superconductor state characterised by the Gizburg-Landau parameter $κ=1.5$, and it is suggested that a probability flux of Cooper pairs (quantum gravitational geons charged with vacuum energy) are directly responsible for the flatness exhibited by the rotation curves in spiral galaxies, as well as the exotic behaviour observed in galactic cluster collisions. If this hypothesis proves correct, the whole phenomenon of dark matter may count, after all, as another triumph for Einstein's theory of gravity. The tension between gravitation and quantum mechanics is explored further by a subtle consideration of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of the York-time action, providing additional motivation for the above line of reasoning. In particular, Penrose's estimate for the rate of collapse of the wavefunction is recovered, and connected to the instability of Misner space.</summary>
