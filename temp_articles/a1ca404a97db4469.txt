    <summary>Graphene-oxide hybrid structures offer the opportunity to combine the versatile functionalities of oxides with the excellent electronic transport in graphene. Understanding and controlling how the dielectric environment affects the intrinsic properties of graphene is also critical to fundamental studies and technological development of graphene. Here we review our recent effort on understanding the transport properties of graphene interfaced with ferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 (PZT) and high-k HfO_2. Graphene field effect devices prepared on high-quality single crystal PZT substrates exhibit up to tenfold increases in mobility compared to SiO_2-gated devices. An unusual and robust resistance hysteresis is observed in these samples, which is attributed to the complex surface chemistry of the ferroelectric. Surface polar optical phonons of oxides in graphene transistors play an important role in the device performance. We review their effects on mobility and the high source-drain bias saturation current of graphene, which are crucial for developing graphene-based room temperature high-speed amplifiers. Oxides also introduce scattering sources that limit the low temperature electron mobility in graphene. We present a comprehensive study of the transport and quantum scattering times to differentiate various scattering scenarios and quantitatively evaluate the density and distribution of charged impurities and the effect of dielectric screening. Our results can facilitate the design of multifunctional nano-devices utilizing graphene-oxide hybrid structures.</summary>

    <title>Birefringent Graphene Oxide Liquid Crystals in Micro-channels for Optical Switch</title>

    <summary>We propose a mechanical-hydrodynamical experimental setup in which the microfluidic motion manipulates the optical birefringence of levitated graphene oxide liquid crystal. The birefringence of the sample is changed by flowing graphene oxide liquid crystal in the micro-channel. By measuring the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices at five flow rates, one can determine the value of the birefringence of the samples, precisely. Our results demonstrate that, by adjusting the concentration and flow rate of dispersion of the graphene oxide nano flakes, the induced birefringence can be controlled. It is also shown that this approach can be used as an optical switch.</summary>

    <title>Nanocrystal Growth on Graphene with Various Degrees of Oxidation</title>

    <summary>  We show a general two-step method to grow hydroxide and oxide nanocrystals of the iron family elements (Ni, Co, Fe) on graphene with two degrees of oxidation. Drastically different nanocrystal growth behaviors were observed on low-oxidation graphene sheets (GS) and highly oxidized graphite oxide (GO) in hydrothermal reactions. Small particles pre-coated on GS with few oxygen-containing surface groups diffused and recrystallized into single-crystalline nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates or iron oxide Fe2O3 nanorods with well defined morphologies. In contrast, particles pre-coated on GO were pinned by the high-concentration oxygen groups and defects on GO without recrystallization into well-defined shapes. Adjusting reaction temperature can be combined to further control materials grown on graphene. For materials with weak interactions with graphene, increasing the reaction temperature can lead to diffusion and recrystallization of surface species into larger crystals even on highly oxidized and defective GO. Our results suggest an interesting new approach to controlling the morphology of nanomaterials grown on graphene by tuning the surface chemistry of graphene as substrates for crystal nucleation and growth.</summary>
