    <summary>  We report the chemical reaction of single-layer graphene with hydrogen atoms, generated in situ by electron-induced dissociation of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). Hydrogenation, forming sp3 C-H functionality on the basal plane of graphene, proceeds at a higher rate for single than for double layers, demonstrating the enhanced chemical reactivity of single sheet graphene. The net H atom sticking probability on single layers at 300 K is at least 0.03, which exceeds that of double layers by at least a factor of 15. Chemisorbed hydrogen atoms, which give rise to a prominent Raman D band, can be detached by thermal annealing at 100~200 degrees C. The resulting dehydrogenated graphene is "activated" when photothermally heated it reversibly binds ambient oxygen, leading to hole doping of the graphene. This functionalization of graphene can be exploited to manipulate electronic and charge transport properties of graphene devices.</summary>

    <summary>Recent progress in controllable functionalization of graphene surfaces enables the experimental realization of complex functionalized graphene nanostructures, such as Sierpinski carpet (SC) fractals. Herein, we model the SC fractals formed by hydrogen and fluorine functionalized patterns on graphene surfaces, namely, H-SC and F-SC, respectively. We then reveal their electronic properties and quantum transport features. From calculated results of the total and local density of state, we find that states in H-SC and F-SC have two characteristics: (i) low-energy states inside about |E/t|&lt;1 (with t as the near-neighbor hopping) are localized inside free graphene regions due to the insulating properties of functionalized graphene regions, and (ii) high-energy states in F-SC have two special energy ranges including -2.3&lt;E/t&lt;-1.9 with localized holes only inside free graphene areas and 3&lt;E/t&lt;3.7 with localized electrons only inside fluorinated graphene areas. The two characteristics are further verified by the real-space distributions of normalized probability density. We analyze the fractal dimension of their quantum conductance spectra and find that conductance fluctuations in these structures follow the Hausdorff dimension. We calculate their optical conductivity and find that several additional conductivity peaks appear in high energy ranges due to the adsorbed H or F atoms.</summary>

    <title>Graphene on Insulating Oxide Substrates: Role of Surface Dangling States</title>
    <updated>2010-01-28T22:08:02Z</updated>

    <summary>  We study the effect of insulating oxide substrates on the energy band structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene using a first principles density functional based electronic structure method and a local exchange correlation approximation. We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz) and Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We focus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in perturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface terminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated quartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large equilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface terminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top surface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with the Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second carbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface layers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with both surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers. By passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top layer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the Fermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important role than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the linear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms ripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found to be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.</summary>
