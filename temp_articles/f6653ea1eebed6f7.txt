    <summary>Chemical functionalization has proven to be a promising means of tailoring the unique properties of graphene. For example, hydrogenation can yield a variety of interesting effects, including a metal-insulator transition or the formation of localized magnetic moments. Meanwhile, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is the most suitable for large-scale production, but the resulting material tends to be polycrystalline. Up to now there has been relatively little focus on how chemical functionalization, and hydrogenation in particular, impacts the properties of polycrystalline graphene. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the electrical properties of hydrogenated polycrystalline graphene. We find a strong correlation between the spatial distribution of the hydrogen adsorbates and the charge transport properties. Charge transport is weakly sensitive to hydrogenation when adsorbates are confined to the grain boundaries, while a uniform distribution of hydrogen degrades the electronic mobility. This difference stems from the formation of the hydrogen-induced resonant impurity states, which are inhibited when the honeycomb symmetry is locally broken by the grain boundaries. These findings suggest a tunability of electrical transport of polycrystalline graphene through selective hydrogen functionalization, and also have implications for hydrogen-induced magnetization and spin lifetime of this material.</summary>

    <title>Large area graphene synthesis on catalytic copper foil by an indigenous electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup</title>

    <summary>A novel route for the synthesis of large area graphene by an indigenously built electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) setup has been reported in this work. A unique 2.45 GHz permanent magnet type ECR PECVD system has been designed and developed for the growth of various nano-structures and films. The apparatus has a unique advantage to synthesize large area graphene at much lower additional substrate heating than heat supplied by an external oven in conventional thermal CVD method. A major amount of heat is supplied here by ECR plasma. Polycrystalline copper foil is used here as a catalytic substrate which is pre annealed inside resonant hydrogen plasma prior to its exposure under precursor gaseous plasma inside the ECR PECVD reactor. Methane is used as carbon precursor along with hydrogen as carrier gas. Argon gas is used for the rapid cooling of the substrate maintaining suitable thermodynamic condition favorable for graphene synthesis. The synthesis process has been carried out by controlling growth temperature, total pressure and synthesis time at various gas ratios. The exposed copper foil has been characterized by Raman spectroscopy to investigate the quality of synthesized graphene in the home made reactor.</summary>

    <title>Triggering the Continuous Growth of Graphene toward Millimeter Size Grain</title>

    <summary>In this report, we demonstrated a simple but efficient strategy to synthesize millimeter-sized graphene single crystal grains by regulating the supply of reactants in chemical vapor deposition process. Polystyrene was used as a carbon source. Pulse heating on the carbon source was utilized to minimize the nucleation density of graphene on copper foil, while the gradual increase in the temperature of carbon source and the flow rate of hydrogen is adapted to drive the continuous growth of graphene grain. As a result, the nucleation density of graphene grain can be controlled as lower as ~100 nuclei/cm2, and the dimension of single crystal grain could grow up to ~1.2 mm. Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electrical transport measurement show that the graphene grains obtained are in high quality. The strategy presented here provides very good controllability and enables the possibility for large graphene single crystals, which is of vital importance for practical applications.</summary>
