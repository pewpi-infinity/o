    <summary>We introduce a semi-classical wavefunction (SCWF) model for strong-field physics and attosecond science. When applied to high harmonic generation (HHG), this formalism allows one to show that the natural time-domain separation of the contribution of ionization, propagation and recollisions to the HHG process leads to a frequency-domain factorization of the harmonic yield into these same contributions, for any choice of atomic or molecular potential. We first derive the factorization from the natural expression of the dipole signal in the temporal domain by using a reference system, as in the quantitative rescattering (QRS) formalism [J. Phys. B. 43, 122001 (2010)]. Alternatively, we show how the trajectory component of the SCWF can be used to express the factorization, which also allows one to attribute individual contributions to the spectrum to the underlying trajectories.</summary>

    <summary>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom and its interaction with coherent intense high-frequency short laser pulses is solved numerically exactly by propagating the single-electron wave packets. Thereby, the wavefunction is followed in space and time for times longer than the pulse duration. Results are explicitly shown for 3 and 10 fs pulses. Particular attention is paid to identifying the effect of dynamic interference of photoelectrons emitted with the same kinetic energy at different times during the rising and falling sides of the pulse predicted in [\emph{Ph.V. Demekhin and L.S. Cederbaum}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 253001 (2012)]. In order to be able to see the dynamic interference pattern in the computed electron spectra, the photoelectron wave packet has to be propagated over long distances. Clearly, complex absorption potentials often employed to compute spectra of emitted particles cannot be used to detect dynamic interference. For the considered high-frequency pulses of 3 and 10 fs durations, this requires enormously large spatial grids. The presently computed photoionization and above-threshold ionization spectra are found to exhibit pronounced dynamic interference patterns. Where available, the patterns are in very good agreement with previously published results on the photoionization spectra which have been computed using a completely different method, thus supporting the previously made assumption that the above-threshold ionization processes are very weak for the considered pulse intensities and high carrier frequency. The quiver motion in space and time of a free electron in strong laser pulses is also investigated numerically. Finally, a discussion is presented of how fast the atom is ionized by an intense pulse.</summary>

    <title>Photoionization Suppression by Continuum Coherence: Experiment and Theory</title>

    <summary>  We present experimental and theoretical results of a detailed study of laser-induced continuum structures (LICS) in the photoionization continuum of helium out of the metastable state 2s $^1S_0$. The continuum dressing with a 1064 nm laser, couples the same region of the continuum to the {4s $^1S_0$} state. The experimental data, presented for a range of intensities, show pronounced ionization suppression (by as much as 70% with respect to the far-from-resonance value) as well as enhancement, in a Beutler-Fano resonance profile. This ionization suppression is a clear indication of population trapping mediated by coupling to a contiuum. We present experimental results demonstrating the effect of pulse delay upon the LICS, and for the behavior of LICS for both weak and strong probe pulses. Simulations based upon numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation model the experimental results. The atomic parameters (Rabi frequencies and Stark shifts) are calculated using a simple model-potential method for the computation of the needed wavefunctions. The simulations of the LICS profiles are in excellent agreement with experiment. We also present an analytic formulation of pulsed LICS. We show that in the case of a probe pulse shorter than the dressing one the LICS profile is the convolution of the power spectra of the probe pulse with the usual Fano profile of stationary LICS. We discuss some consequences of deviation from steady-state theory.</summary>
