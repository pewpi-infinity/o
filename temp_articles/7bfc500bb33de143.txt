    <summary>This report is a primarily survey on the chemical nature of some exotic species containing the positively charged muon and the muonic Helium, i.e., the negatively charged muon plus helium nucleus, as exotic isotopes of hydrogen, using the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (MC-QTAIM) analysis, employing ab initio non-Born-Oppenhiemer wavefunctions. Accordingly, the "atoms in molecules" analysis performed on various asymmetric exotic isotopomers of hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally [Science 331, 448 (2011)], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are capable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen atom. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing muonic helium cast no doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of hydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon are more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of appreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization; however, with some tolerance, they may be categorized also as hydrogen basins though with a smaller electronegativity. All in all, present study also clearly demonstrates that the MC-QTAIM analysis is an efficient approach to decipher the chemical nature of species containing exotic constituents, hard to be elucidated by experimental and/or alternative theoretical schemes.</summary>

    <summary>In a recent study it was suggested that the positively charged muon is capable of forming its own "atoms in molecule"s (AIM) in the muonic hydrogen-like molecules, composed of two electrons, a muon and one of the hydrogen isotopes, thus deserved to be placed in the Periodic Table [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16, 6602, 2014]. In present report, the capacity of the positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners within context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their congener hydrides and no new bonding models is required to describe the bonding of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively charged muon is similar to proton from structural and bonding viewpoint and deserved to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of the muonic molecules portraying the positively charged muon as a lighter isotope of hydrogen.</summary>

    <title>The calculation of the muon transfer rate from protium to neon on the ground of a two-centre Coulomb basis</title>

    <summary>Results of improved calculations of the muon transfer rate from the 1S-state of muonic protium to neon are presented in the interval of collision energies from 10^(-4) eV to 15 eV. The calculations were made within the PSS method in which the three-body wavefunction is expanded in eigenfunctions of a two- centre Coulomb problem formulated in the Jacobi coordinates of the entrance channel. This approach provides the asymptotically correct description of this channel: the correct dissociation limit is obtained, there are no spurious long-range interactions, the polarization attraction appears naturally, the electron screening can be easily taken into account. The defects of the description are removed into the muon transfer channel in which their effect is not expected to be too significant because of large kinetic energies there. The previous calculations carried out in this way allowed one to explain experimentally observed features of the temperature dependence of the transfer rate in hydrogen-neon mixtures. In the present work, a more perfect algorithm of constructing the basis eigenfunctions has been realized and a better agreement with experimental data has been obtained.</summary>
