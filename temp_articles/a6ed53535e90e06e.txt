    <summary>The development of Kondo lattice coherence in UTe2 leads to the formation of a heavy Fermi liquid state from which superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</summary>

    <title>rf Breakdown with and without External Magnetic Fields</title>

    <summary>  Neutrino Factories and Muon Colliders' cooling lattices require both high gradient rf and strong focusing solenoids. Experiments have shown that there may be serious problems operating rf in the required magnetic fields. The use of high pressure gas to avoid these problems is discussed, including possible loss problems from electron and ion production by the passage of an ionizing beam. It is also noted that high pressure gas cannot be used in later stages of cooling for a muon collider. Experimental observations using vacuum rf cavities in magnetic fields are discussed, current published models of breakdown with and without magnetic fields are summarized, and some of their predictions compared with observations.
  A new theory of magnetic field dependent breakdown is presented. It is proposed that electrons emitted by field emission on asperities on one side of a cavity are focused by the magnetic field to the other side where they melt the cavity surface in small spots. Metal is then electrostatically drawn from the molten spots, becomes vaporized and ionized by field emission from the remaining damage and cause breakdown. The theory is fitted to existing 805 MHz data and predictions are made for performance at 201 MHz. The model predicts breakdown gradients significantly below those specified for either the International Scoping Study (ISS) Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider.
  Possible solutions to these problems are discussed, including designs for `magnetically insulated rf' in which the cavity walls are designed to be parallel to a chosen magnetic field contour line and consequently damage from field emission is suppressed. An experimental program to study these problems and their possible solution is outlined.</summary>

    <summary>A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$, transfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus. The energy lost by electron is more than the energy gained by the nucleus. The resulting energy goes in exciting the atom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon, mercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber experiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper, we study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering experiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth, why muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like lead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the elastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron microscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these phenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give Bloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give resistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and superconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in Fermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures. Electron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions. We turn our attention to electron-proton scattering both eleastic and inelastic, as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and understand the independence of ineleastic cross-section of with respect to transferred momentum. We see, why we can just say that there are three quarks in proton from elastic cross-section. Our main contribution in this article is we are detailed at places, we find literature terse.</summary>
