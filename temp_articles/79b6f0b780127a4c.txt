    <summary>The Moon-forming giant impact extensively melts and partially vaporizes the silicate Earth and delivers a substantial mass of metal to Earth's core. Subsequent evolution of the magma ocean and overlying atmosphere has been described by theoretical models but observable constraints on this epoch have proved elusive. Here, we report calculations of the primordial atmosphere during the magma ocean and water ocean epochs and forge new links with observations to gain insight into the behavior of volatiles on the early Earth. As Earth's magma ocean crystallizes, it outgasses the bulk of the volatiles into the primordial atmosphere. The redox state of the magma ocean controls both the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen isotopic composition of water oceans that remain after hydrogen loss from the primordial atmosphere. Whereas water condenses and is retained, molecular hydrogen does not condense and can escape, allowing large quantities (~10^2 bars) of hydrogen - if present - to be lost from Earth in this epoch. Because the escaping inventory of H can be comparable to the hydrogen inventory in the early oceans, the corresponding deuterium enrichment can be large with a magnitude that depends on the initial H2 inventory. By contrast, the common view that terrestrial water has a carbonaceous chondrite source requires the oceans to preserve the isotopic composition of that source, undergoing minimal D-enrichment via H2 loss. Such minimal enrichment places upper limits on the amount of primordial H2 in contact with early water oceans (pH2&lt;20 bars), implies oxidizing conditions for outgassing from the magma ocean, and suggests that Earth's mantle supplied the oxidant for the chemical resorption of metals during late accretion.</summary>

    <title>Rapid oxygen exchange between hematite and water vapor</title>

    <summary>Oxygen exchange at oxide/liquid and oxide/gas interfaces is important in technology and environmental studies, as it is closely linked to both catalytic activity and material degradation. The atomic-scale details are mostly unknown, however, and are often ascribed to poorly defined defects in the crystal lattice. Here we show that even thermodynamically stable, well-ordered surfaces can be surprisingly reactive. Specifically, we show that all the 3-fold coordinated lattice oxygen atoms on a defect-free single-crystalline r-cut (1-102) surface of hematite (α-Fe2O3) are exchanged with oxygen from surrounding water vapor within minutes at temperatures below 70 °C, while the atomic-scale surface structure is unperturbed by the process. A similar behavior is observed after liquid water exposure, but the experimental data clearly show most of the exchange happens during desorption of the final monolayer, not during immersion. Density functional theory computations show that the exchange can happen during on-surface diffusion, where the cost of the lattice oxygen extraction is compensated by the stability of an HO-HOH-OH complex. Such insights into lattice oxygen stability are highly relevant for many research fields ranging from catalysis and hydrogen production to geochemistry and paleoclimatology.</summary>

    <title>Seeding ice growth at ambient conditions using nano graphene oxide</title>

    <summary>Water wetting on a hydrophobic surface at ambient conditions is disallowed by the nonpolar nature of the surface and high vapor pressure of water. However, the presence of sub-millimeter sized hydrophilic patches allows the waxy wings of desert beetles to become wettable by morning mist. Here, we show that a sprinkle of graphene oxide nanoflakes (nanoGOs) is effective in condensing water nanodroplets and seeding ice epitaxy on graphite at ambient conditions. By controlling relative humidity and nanoGO density, we are able to study the formation of a complete ice wetting layer on a time scale of 20 hours. This presents an unprecedented opportunity to visualize ice nucleation and growth in real time using non-contact atomic force microscopy. The stages of crystallization, as proposed by Ostwald in 1897, is fully unfolded at a microscopic level for the first time. We obtain real-time imaging of sequential phase transition from amorphous ice to a transient cubic ice Ic stage and finally to the stable hexagonal ice Ih. Most interestingly, we discover that ice nucleation and growth can be influenced by modifying the functional groups of nanoGO, and by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding between nanoGOs. This affords a strategy to control heterogenous ice nucleation and snow crystal formation.</summary>
