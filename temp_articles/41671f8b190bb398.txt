    <summary>Pairwise conversions of neutrinos have complicated the challenging goal of quantifying the relevance of neutrino microphysics in compact astrophysical objects, limiting the ability to perform numerical simulations and encouraging the employment of semi-analytical tools, such as the linear stability analysis. Given the high neutrino density, the dependence of pairwise conversions on the neutrino energy has been deemed to play a negligible role. We show that fast pairwise conversions are affected by the neutrino energy, especially in the non-linear regime. An earlier onset of flavor conversions and a higher oscillation frequency are found as the vacuum frequency increases (i.e., the neutrino energy decreases); the oscillation periodicity, otherwise present, is gradually destroyed as the vacuum frequency increases. Such effects are, however, not further exacerbated by the inclusion of spectral energy distributions for neutrinos, contrary to what was found for "slow" neutrino-neutrino conversions. In addition, our findings highlight the dependence of fast pairwise conversions on the neutrino mass ordering for realistic values of the neutrino vacuum frequency. Our findings highlight the limitations intrinsic to widely adopted approximations and extrapolations based on the linear regime of fast conversions. In order to gauge their possible impact on the source physics, a more sophisticated modeling of pairwise conversions is necessary.</summary>

    <summary>In presence of matter the possibility of flavor oscillation of massless neutrino is explored. A comparison between vacuum oscillation and the matter induced oscillation of massless neutrinos is carried out to examine whether the flavor transition is possible in the framework of standard model if there is background matter. The Stodolsky type of equation describing the neutrino oscillation phenomenon as the motion of a spherical pendulum in flavor space is deduced. That pendular model is studied with zero vacuum oscillation frequency implying the zero neutrino mass evolved in the framework of standard model, but non-zero frequency arising due to the MSW effect. The implication of the non-zero term present in the Stodolsky equation at zero vacuum frequency is addressed properly.</summary>

    <title>Energy Dependence of Flavor Instabilities Stemming from Crossings in the Neutrino Flavor Lepton Number Angular Distribution</title>

    <summary>In core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino-neutrino refraction can lead to flavor conversion, if a zero-crossing is present in the neutrino flavor lepton number (FLN) angular distribution and the neutrino self-interaction strength $μ=\sqrt{2} G_F n_ν$ represents the characteristic timescale of the system. It has been empirically realized that the vacuum frequency $ω=Δm^2/2E$ affects the development of flavor conversion in the presence of zero-crossing even if $ω\ll μ$. Focusing on a homogeneous and axially symmetric neutrino gas, we explore the role of $ω$ in the onset of flavor instabilities. We find that a non-zero vacuum frequency can be responsible for inducing flavor instabilities even when the neutrino self-interaction strength is much larger than the vacuum frequency. Moreover, mapping a neutrino ensemble with $ω\neq 0$ into an effective system with $ω=0$, we find that a system with no FLN zero-crossing can effectively develop one for $ω\neq 0$ becoming unstable.</summary>
