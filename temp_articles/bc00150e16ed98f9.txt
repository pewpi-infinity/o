    <summary>We present studies of an effective model which is a simple generalization of the standard model of a local pair superconductor with on-site pairing (i.e., the model of hard core bosons on a lattice) to the case of finite pair binding energy. The tight binding Hamiltonian consists of (i) the effective on-site interaction U, (ii) the intersite density-density interactions W between nearest-neighbours, and (iii) the intersite charge exchange term I, determining the hopping of electron pairs between nearest-neighbour sites. In the analysis of the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of this model we treat the intersite interactions within the mean-field approximation. Our investigations of the U&lt;0 and W&gt;0 case show that, depending on the values of interaction parameters, the system can exhibit three homogeneous phases: superconducting (SS), charge-ordered (CO) and nonordered (NO) as well as the phase separated SS-CO state.</summary>

    <summary>We review briefly the properties of a mixture of mutually interacting bosons (bound electron pairs) and itinerant fermions on a lattice (the boson-fermion model). The calculations of the superconducting phase transition temperature ($T_{c}$) and the phase diagram are the main concern. The self-consistent $T$-matrix method is applied to determine the superconducting critical temperature from a pseudogap phase. The method takes into account the pairing fluctuations effects. The $T$-matrix results for $T_{c}$ are given for a 3D cubic lattice with tight-binding dispersion of electrons and standard bosons, and they are also compared with those of the BCS- mean-field approximation (MFA). Our results describe the BCS-Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover in the boson-fermion mixture with resonant interaction. The energy scales involved in the pseudogap formation are also analysed.

    <title>Superconductivity mediated by charge fluctuations in layered molecular crystals</title>

    <summary>  In elemental metals the pairing of electrons leading to superconductivity is mediated by the vibrations of the crystal lattice and the pairs have spherical symmetry. For layered organic molecular crystals there is no consensus about the pairing symmetry or the mechanism of the superconductivity. We show theoretically that the mechanism of superconductivity for members of the (BEDT-TTF)2X family with the theta and beta'' crystal structures is mediated by charge fluctuations and the superconducting order parameter has dxy symmetry. This is in contrast to the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X family, for which theoretical calculations give superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations and with dx2-y2 symmetry. Our conclusions are based on systematic many-body calculations using slave-boson theory of an extended Hubbard model. This is the simplest model that can describe the competition between metallic, superconducting, insulating, and charge ordered phases that occurs in the theta and beta'' materials. Based on the theory presented we predict several materials that should become superconducting under pressure.</summary>
