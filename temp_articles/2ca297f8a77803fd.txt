    <summary>Intensive research has focused on harnessing the potential of graphene for electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices by generating a bandgap at the Dirac point and enhancing the spin-orbit interaction in the graphene layer. Proximity to heavy p elements is a promising approach; however, their interaction in graphene heterostructures has not been as intensively studied as that of ferromagnetic, noble, or heavy d metals, neither as interlayers nor as substrates. In this study, the effective intercalation of Te atoms in a graphene on Ir(111) heterostructure is achieved. Combining techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, the structural evolution of the system as a function of the Te coverage is elucidated, uncovering up to two distinct phases. The presented angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy analysis reveals the emergence of a bandgap of about 240 meV in the Dirac cone at room temperature, which preserves its characteristic linear dispersion. Furthermore, a pronounced n-doping effect induced by Te in the heterostructure is also observed, and remarkably the possibility of tuning the Dirac point energy towards the Fermi level by reducing the Te coverage while maintaining the open bandgap is demonstrated. Spin-resolved measurements unveil a non-planar chiral spin texture with significant splitting values for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin components. These experimental findings are consistent with the development of a quantum spin Hall phase, where a Te-enhanced intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene surpasses the Rashba one and promotes the opening of the spin-orbit bandgap.</summary>

    <summary>The valley in the band structure of materials has gained a lot of attention recently. The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.</summary>

    <title>Proximity-induced topological transition and strain-induced charge transfer in graphene/MoS2 bilayer heterostructures</title>

    <summary>Graphene/MoS2 heterostructures are formed by combining the nanosheets of graphene and monolayer MoS2. The electronic features of both constituent monolayers are rather well-preserved in the resultant heterostructure due to the weak van der Waals interaction between the layers. However, the proximity of MoS2 induces strong spin orbit coupling effect of strength ~1 meV in graphene, which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic spin orbit coupling of pristine graphene. This opens a bandgap in graphene and further causes anticrossings of the spin-nondegenerate bands near the Dirac point. Lattice incommensurate graphene/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits interesting moire' patterns which have been observed in experiments. The electronic bandstructure of heterostructure is very sensitive to biaxial strain and interlayer twist. Although the Dirac cone of graphene remains intact and no charge-transfer between graphene and MoS2 layers occurs at ambient conditions, a strain-induced charge-transfer can be realized in graphene/MoS2 heterostructure. Application of a gate voltage reveals the occurrence of a topological phase transition in graphene/MoS2 heterostructure. In this chapter, we discuss the crystal structure, interlayer effects, electronic structure, spin states, and effects due to strain and substrate proximity on the electronic properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructure. We further present an overview of the distinct topological quantum phases of graphene/MoS2 heterostructure and review the recent advancements in this field.</summary>
