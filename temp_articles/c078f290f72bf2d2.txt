    <summary>  We present a 2+1-dimensional lattice model for the copper oxide superconductors and their parent compounds, in which both the charge and spin degrees of freedom are treated dynamically. The spin-charge coupling parameter is associated to the doping fraction in the cuprates. The model is able to account for the various phases of the cuprates and their properties, not only at low and intermediate doping but also for (highly) over-doped compounds. We acquire a qualitative understanding of high-$T_c$ superconductivity as a Bose-Einstein condensation of bound charge pairs.</summary>

    <summary>  In elemental metals the pairing of electrons leading to superconductivity is mediated by the vibrations of the crystal lattice and the pairs have spherical symmetry. For layered organic molecular crystals there is no consensus about the pairing symmetry or the mechanism of the superconductivity. We show theoretically that the mechanism of superconductivity for members of the (BEDT-TTF)2X family with the theta and beta'' crystal structures is mediated by charge fluctuations and the superconducting order parameter has dxy symmetry. This is in contrast to the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X family, for which theoretical calculations give superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations and with dx2-y2 symmetry. Our conclusions are based on systematic many-body calculations using slave-boson theory of an extended Hubbard model. This is the simplest model that can describe the competition between metallic, superconducting, insulating, and charge ordered phases that occurs in the theta and beta'' materials. Based on the theory presented we predict several materials that should become superconducting under pressure.</summary>

    <title>Exotic s-wave superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerides</title>

    <summary>Alkali-doped fullerides (A3C60 with A=K, Rb, Cs) show a surprising phase diagram, in which a high transition-temperature (Tc) s-wave superconducting state emerges next to a Mott insulating phase as a function of the lattice spacing. This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and phonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental question on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article reviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing comprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and elucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the electron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an unconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A driving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions, characterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction and a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a subtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and Hund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction leads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules, which enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially relies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits from the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic energy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in agreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped fullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual synergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc superconductivity.</summary>
