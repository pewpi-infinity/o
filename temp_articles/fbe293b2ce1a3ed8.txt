    <summary>Quantum magnetism describes the properties of many materials such as transition metal oxides and cuprate superconductors. One of its elementary processes is the propagation of spin excitations. Here we study the quantum dynamics of a deterministically created spin-impurity atom, as it propagates in a one-dimensional lattice system. We probe the full spatial probability distribution of the impurity at different times using single-site-resolved imaging of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the Mott-insulating regime, a post-selection of the data allows to reduce the effect of temperature, giving access to a space- and time-resolved measurement of the quantum-coherent propagation of a magnetic excitation in the Heisenberg model. Extending the study to the bath's superfluid regime, we determine quantitatively how the bath strongly affects the motion of the impurity. The experimental data shows a remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions allowing us to determine the effect of temperature on the coherence and velocity of impurity motion. Our results pave the way for a new approach to study quantum magnetism, mobile impurities in quantum fluids, and polarons in lattice systems.</summary>

    <summary>Density-functional theory calculations are performed to investigate hydrogen transport in the proton conductor BaSnO$_3$. Structural optimizations in the stable and saddle point configurations for transfer and reorientation allow description of the high-temperature classical and semi-classical regimes, in which diffusion occurs by over-barrier motion. At lower temperature (typically below 300 K), we describe a thermally-assisted quantum regime. In this regime, transfer and reorientation occur when the surrounding matrix adopts particular "coincidence" configurations in which quantum tunneling is favored. Both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic cases are examined. In the adiabatic case, the energy landscape of hydrogen in the coincidence configuration is very flat, with very low coincidence energy barriers. Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations of the H atom in the coincidence potential reveal, in the transfer case, highly quantum behavior up to T=300 K (the density of probability of H in the coincidence configuration, has its maximum at the saddle point, due to the fact that the zero-point energy exceeds the coincidence energy barrier). Arguments are given that support the adiabatic picture for the transfer mechanism. This suggests existence of this state of hydrogen during the very short lifetime of the coincidence configurations ($\sim$ 10$^{-13}$ s), as a transition state for the transfer mechanism. Remarkably, such state is identical to that of ice X, a highly quantum phase of ice observed at high pressures $\approx$ 100 GPa. In the case of reorientation, typical times for existence of the coincidence configuration and for protonic motion are roughly equal, suggesting that the adiabatic picture is not valid. Protonic transfer and reorientation in oxides are therefore governed by radically different mechanisms below room temperature.</summary>

    <title>Variability and Fidelity Limits of Silicon Quantum Gates Due to Random Interface Charge Traps</title>

    <summary>Silicon offers an attractive material platform for hardware realization of quantum computing. In this study, a microscopic stochastic simulation method is developed to model the effect of random interface charge traps in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum gates. The statistical results show that by using a fast two-qubit gate in isotopically purified silicon, the two-qubit silicon-based quantum gates have the fidelity &gt;98% with a probability of 75% for the state-of-the-art MOS interface quality. By using a composite gate pulse, the fidelity can be further improved to &gt;99.5% with the 75% probability. The variations between the quantum gate devices, however, are largely due to the small number of traps per device. The results highlight the importance of variability consideration due to random charge traps and potential to improve fidelity in silicon-based quantum computing.</summary>
