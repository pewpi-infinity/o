    <summary>The possibility that muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion at ambient temperature takes place in deuterated metals is analyzed theoretically. It is suggested that the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt) fusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD crystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium diffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the rate of (d$μ$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the possibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point to an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the probability of $μ^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be evaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we advance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered by cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special conditions, a mW power per $μ^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent experimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in out-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation. However, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically, and an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify or invalidate this idea.</summary>

    <summary>A number of popular extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of doubly charged scalar particles $X^{\pm\pm}$. Such particles may be long-lived or even stable. If exist, $X^{--}$ could form atomic bound states with light nuclei and catalyze their fusion by essentially eliminating the Coulomb barrier between them. Such an $X$-catalyzed fusion ($X$CF) process does not require high temperatures or pressure and may have important applications for energy production. A similar process of muon-catalyzed fusion ($μ$CF) has been shown not to be a viable source of energy because of the sticking of negative muons to helium nuclei produced in the fusion of hydrogen isotopes, which stops the catalytic process. We analyze $X$CF in deuterium environments and show that the $X$-particles can only stick to $^6$Li nuclei, which are produced in the third-stage reactions downstream in the catalytic cycle. The corresponding sticking probability is very low, and, before getting bound to $^6$Li, each $X$-particle can catalyze $\sim 3.5\cdot 10^{9}$ fusion cycles, producing $\sim 7\cdot 10^{4}$ TeV of energy. We also discuss the ways of reactivating the $X$-particles from the Coulomb-bound (${\rm ^6Li}X$) states, which would allow re-using them in $X$CF reactions.</summary>
