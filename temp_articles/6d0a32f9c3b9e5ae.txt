    <summary>According to classical GR, negative-energy (AdS) bubbles in the multiverse terminate in big crunch singularities. It has been conjectured, however, that the fundamental theory may resolve these singularities and replace them by non-singular bounces. Here we explore possible dynamics of such bounces using a simple modification of the Friedmann equation, which ensures that the scale factor bounces when the matter density reaches some critical value $ρ_c$. This is combined with a simple scalar field `landscape', where the energy barriers between different vacua are small compared to $ρ_c$. We find that the bounce typically results in a transition to another vacuum, with a scalar field displacement $Δφ\sim 1$ in Planck units. If the new vacuum is AdS, we have another bounce, and so on, until the field finally transits to a positive-energy (de Sitter) vacuum. We also consider perturbations about the homogeneous solution and discuss some of their amplification mechanisms (e.g., tachyonic instability and parametric resonance). For a generic potential, these mechanisms are much less efficient than in models of slow-roll inflation. But the amplification may still be strong enough to cause the bubble to fragment into a mosaic of different vacua.</summary>

    <summary>It is shown here that the zero mode of any form field can be trapped to the brane using the model proposed by Ghoroku and Nakamura. We start proven that the equations of motion can be obtained without splitting the field in even and odd parts. The massive and tachyonic cases are studied revealing that this mechanism only traps the zero mode. The result is then generalized to thick branes. In this scenario, the use of a delta like interaction of the quadratic term is necessary leading to a "mixed" potential with singular and smooth contributions. It is also shown that all forms produces an effective theory in the brane without gauge fixing. The existence of resonances with the transfer matrix method is then discussed. With this we analyze the resonances and look for peaks indicating the existence of unstable modes. Curiously no resonances are found in opposition of other models in the literature. Finally we find analytical solutions for arbitrary $p-$forms when a specific kind of smooth scenario is considered.</summary>

    <summary>We consider two established supergravities which are known to provide the low-energy effective description of either superstring theory or M-theory: the six-dimensional theory of Romans, and the maximal supergravity in seven dimensions. We compactify on an $S^{1}$ and $T^{2}$, respectively, to obtain 5D sigma-models coupled to gravity, and spectra of bosonic excitations are computed numerically by fluctuating fields on backgrounds which holographically realise confinement. We propose a method to detect mixing effects between scalar resonances and the pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance: the dilaton. This test consists of neglecting a key component of the spin-0 fluctuation variables, effectively disregarding their back-reaction on the underlying geometry; where discrepancies arise compared to the proper calculation we infer dilaton mixing. In both cases this analysis evinces a parametrically light dilaton. For each theory we also uncover a tachyonic instability within their parameter space. We hence proceed to investigate their respective phase structures, reasoning that some mechanism must render the instabilities physically inaccessible. We compile a catalogue of geometrically distinct backgrounds within each theory, and derive general expressions for their holographically renormalised free energy $F$. Another numerical routine is used to systematically extract data for some special deformation parameters, and $F$ is plotted in units of an appropriate universal scale. Our analysis proves fruitful: each theory shows evidence of a first-order phase transition which induces the spontaneous decompactification of the shrinking dimension before the instability manifests, favouring instead a branch of singular solutions. The light dilaton resonance appears only along a metastable portion of the branch of confining backgrounds.</summary>
