    <summary>The dynamical evolution of terrestrial planets resembling Mercury in the vicinity of spin-orbit resonances is investigated using comprehensive harmonic expansions of the tidal torque taking into account the frequency-dependent quality factors and Love numbers. The torque equations are integrated numerically with a small step in time, includng the oscillating triaxial torque components but neglecting the layered structure of the planet and assuming a zero obliquity. We find that a Mercury-like planet with its current value of orbital eccentricity (0.2056) is always captured in the 3:2 resonance. The probability of capture in the higher 2:1 resonance is approximately 0.23. These results are confirmed by a semi-analytical estimation of capture probabilities as functions of eccentricity for both prograde and retrograde evolution of spin rate. As follows from analysis of equilibrium torques, entrapment in the 3:2 resonance is inevitable at eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.41. Considering the phase space parameters at the times of periastron, the range of spin rates and phase angles, for which an immediate resonance passage is triggered, is very narrow, and yet, a planet like Mercury rarely fails to align itself into this state of unstable equilibrium before it traverses the 2:1 resonance.</summary>

    <summary>  The rotation of Mercury is presently captured in a 3/2 spin-orbit resonance with the orbital mean motion. The capture mechanism is well understood as the result of tidal interactions with the Sun combined with planetary perturbations. However, it is now almost certain that Mercury has a liquid core, which should induce a contribution of viscous friction at the core-mantle boundary to the spin evolution. This last effect greatly increases the chances of capture in all spin-orbit resonances, being 100% for the 2/1 resonance, and thus preventing the planet from evolving to the presently observed configuration. Here we show that for a given resonance, as the chaotic evolution of Mercury's orbit can drive its eccentricity to very low values during the planet's history, any previous capture can be destabilized whenever the eccentricity becomes lower than a critical value. In our numerical integrations of 1000 orbits of Mercury over 4 Gyr, the spin ends 99.8% of the time captured in a spin-orbit resonance, in particular in one of the following three configurations: 5/2 (22%), 2/1 (32%) and 3/2 (26%). Although the present 3/2 spin-orbit resonance is not the most probable outcome, we also show that the capture probability in this resonance can be increased up to 55% or 73%, if the eccentricity of Mercury in the past has descended below the critical values 0.025 or 0.005, respectively.</summary>

    <summary>The Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) and related spin-dependent excitations in heavy even-even axial nuclei are studied within the Wigner Function Moments method. The calculations are based on the Time Dependent Hartree-Fock equations for the density matrix which are converted into the equations for the spin-dependent Wigner function. Integrating them over the phase space with the weights $r_μ$ and $p_μ$ one gets the equations that describe the coupled dynamics of the first rank tensors associated with electric dipole ($E1$) and magnetic quadrupole ($M2$) responses.
  The energies and excitation probabilities of the $K^π=0^-$ and $K^π=1^-$ GDR components are calculated. The influence of spin degrees of freedom on the characteristics of GDR is estimated. The spin degrees of freedom give rise to the charge-conserving electric Spin Dipole Resonance (SDR) and magnetic quadrupole excitations. The properties of the SDR are studied. The energies of the magnetic quadrupole isovector and isoscalar excitations as well as the spin contribution to the corresponding transition strengths are estimated. The induced by deformation $K$-splitting of the $M2$ excitations are discussed.</summary>
