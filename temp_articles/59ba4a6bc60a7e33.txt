    <summary>Bosonic quantum fields can be simulated with `quantum software' in phase-space. The positive-P, Wigner and Q-function phase-space methods are reviewed. Initial quantum states and boundaries for infinite domains are considered in detail. The quantum initial conditions treated include both multi-mode Gaussian states and number states, which are sampled using phase-shifted weighting techniques. This is more efficient than direct probabilistic sampling. Algorithms for treating periodic boundaries within infinite domains are developed via apodisation, or absorbers near the boundary. Similar truncation or anti-aliasing issues arise in the frequency domain with Fourier transform methods. Complex apodisation, in which there are phase-shifts as well as absorption, improves accuracy by reducing unwanted errors, and this is illustrated numerically. The complex power law apodisation techniques described here can be applied to numerical calculations or even directly in optics. Phase-space simulations, used for both quantum optical and Bose-Einstein condensate quantum dynamical calculations, require quantum noise terms to be included. A method is described to analyze number conservation in apodised calculations. Some techniques developed here are potentially applicable to all digital simulations, whether using classical or quantum logic.</summary>

    <summary>Understanding dynamics of localized quantum systems embedded in engineered bosonic environments is a central problem in quantum optics and open quantum system theory. We present a formalism for studying few-particle scattering from a localized quantum system interacting with an bosonic bath described by an inhomogeneous wave-equation. In particular, we provide exact relationships between the quantum scattering matrix of this interacting system and frequency domain solutions of the inhomogeneous wave-equation thus providing access to the spatial distribution of the scattered few-particle wave-packet. The formalism developed in this paper paves the way to computationally understanding the impact of structured media on the scattering properties of localized quantum systems embedded in them without simplifying assumptions on the physics of the structured media.</summary>

    <title>Dynamics of the spin-boson model with a structured environment</title>

    <summary>  We investigate the dynamics of the spin-boson model when the spectral density of the boson bath shows a resonance at a characteristic frequency $Ω$ but behaves Ohmically at small frequencies. The time evolution of an initial state is determined by making use of the mapping onto a system composed of a quantum mechanical two-state system (TSS) which is coupled to a harmonic oscillator (HO) with frequency $Ω$. The HO itself is coupled to an Ohmic environment. The dynamics is calculated by employing the numerically exact quasiadiabatic path-integral propagator technique. We find significant new properties compared to the Ohmic spin-boson model. By reducing the TSS-HO system in the dressed states picture to a three-level system for the special case at resonance, we calculate the dephasing rates for the TSS analytically. Finally, we apply our model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to an underdamped dc-SQUID detector.</summary>
