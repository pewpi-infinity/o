    <summary>Four-nitrogen-containing 5,6,13,14-Tetraazapentacene (BTANC) has attracted attention as a new n-type organic semiconductor with a rigid crystalline phase due to intermolecular CH-N hydrogen bonding. However, in the thin film transistor of BTANC, poor carrier transport properties and low stability in the ambient condition have been reported so far; thus further refining and understanding of the thin film of BTANC will be required. Here, by means of carefully-controlled vacuum deposition of BTANC in the narrow window of temperature avoiding impurity sublimation and thermal degradation of molecules, we produced a well-defined monolayer on Cu(111) for molecular-level investigations. Synchrotron photoemission of the monolayer revealed a noticeable alteration of the chemical state of N atoms, which is unexpected for the pure BTANC molecule. In addition, molecular imaging of the monolayer by scanning tunneling microscope (STM) revealed that the molecular packing structure in the monolayer significantly differed from that in the single crystal of BTANC. These observations can be interpreted as a result of the partial hydrogenation of N atoms in BTANC and the emergence of the NH-N type intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the monolayer. These findings will provide a general remark and strategy to control the molecular packing structure and electronic property in the molecular films of the nitrogen-containing acenes, by means of controlled hydrogenation.</summary>

    <title>Effect of surface orientation on blistering of copper under high fluence keV hydrogen ion irradiation</title>

    <summary>Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.</summary>

    <title>The trap DOS in small molecule organic semiconductors: A quantitative comparison of thin-film transistors with single crystals</title>

    <summary>  We show that it is possible to reach one of the ultimate goals of organic electronics: producing organic field-effect transistors with trap densities as low as in the bulk of single crystals. We studied the spectral density of localized states in the band gap (trap DOS) of small molecule organic semiconductors as derived from electrical characteristics of organic field-effect transistors or from space-charge-limited-current measurements. This was done by comparing data from a large number of samples including thin-film transistors (TFT's), single crystal field-effect transistors (SC-FET's) and bulk samples. The compilation of all data strongly suggests that structural defects associated with grain boundaries are the main cause of "fast" hole traps in TFT's made with vacuum-evaporated pentacene. For high-performance transistors made with small molecule semiconductors such as rubrene it is essential to reduce the dipolar disorder caused by water adsorbed on the gate dielectric surface. In samples with very low trap densities, we sometimes observe a steep increase of the trap DOS very close (&lt;0.15 eV) to the mobility edge with a characteristic slope of 10-20 meV. It is discussed to what degree band broadening due to the thermal fluctuation of the intermolecular transfer integral is reflected in this steep increase of the trap DOS. Moreover, we show that the trap DOS in TFT's with small molecule semiconductors is very similar to the trap DOS in hydrogenated amorphous silicon even though polycrystalline films of small molecules with van der Waals-type interaction on the one hand are compared with covalently bound amorphous silicon on the other hand.</summary>
