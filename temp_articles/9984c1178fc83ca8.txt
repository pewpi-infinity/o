    <summary>We propose a similarity between the scenario of fate of false vacuum in cosmology at early universe and the situation in where the quantum state decays in superconducting Flux qubit. This is due to the fact that both cases have two homogeneous stable equilibrium states in scalar field, which in quantum theory, could penetrate through the barrier in different possibilities and hence considered unstable decaying in time. In quantum computation, decay rate is among the most important factors in characteristics of the system like coherency, reliability, measurement fidelity, etc. In this considered potential, the decay rate from the penetrating (False vacuum) state to the stable (absolute minimum) state is achieved to leading order in Planck constant by the approach of Instanton model. In case of the superconducting flux qubit having thin barrier potential, the decay rate is calculated and its relations with actual set of parameters in flux qubit design are introduced.</summary>

    <summary>The ability to generate particles from the quantum vacuum is one of the most profound consequences of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Although the significance of vacuum fluctuations can be seen throughout physics, the experimental realization of vacuum amplification effects has until now been limited to a few cases. Superconducting circuit devices, driven by the goal to achieve a viable quantum computer, have been used in the experimental demonstration of the dynamical Casimir effect, and may soon be able to realize the elusive verification of analogue Hawking radiation. This article describes several mechanisms for generating photons from the quantum vacuum and emphasizes their connection to the well-known parametric amplifier from quantum optics. Discussed in detail is the possible realization of each mechanism, or its analogue, in superconducting circuit systems. The ability to selectively engineer these circuit devices highlights the relationship between the various amplification mechanisms.</summary>

    <title>Vacuum superconductivity, conventional superconductivity and Schwinger pair production</title>

    <summary>In a background of a very strong magnetic field a quantum vacuum may turn into a new phase characterized by anisotropic electromagnetic superconductivity. The phase transition should take place at a critical magnetic field of the hadronic strength (B_c \approx 10^{16} Tesla or eB_c \approx 0.6 GeV^2). The transition occurs due to an interplay between electromagnetic and strong interactions: virtual quark-antiquark pairs popup from the vacuum and create -- due to the presence of the intense magnetic field -- electrically charged and electrically neutral spin-one condensates with quantum numbers of ρmesons. The ground state of the new phase is a complicated honeycomblike superposition of superconductor and superfluid vortex lattices surrounded by overlapping charged and neutral condensates. In this talk we discuss similarities and differences between the superconducting state of vacuum and conventional superconductivity, and between the magnetic-field-induced vacuum superconductivity and electric-field-induced Schwinger pair production.</summary>
