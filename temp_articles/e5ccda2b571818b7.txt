    <summary>The paper is devoted to the proof of the uniqueness theorem for solution of the equation for the non-local ionization source in a glow discharge and a hollow cathode in general 3D geometry. The theorem is applied to wide class of electric field configurations, and to the walls of discharge volume, which have a property of incomplete absorption of the electrons. Cathode is regarded as interior singular source, which is placed arbitrarily close to the wall. The existence of solution is considered also. During the proof of the theorem many of useful structure formulae are obtained. Elements of the proof structure, which have arisen, are found to have physical sense. It makes clear physical construction of non-local electron avalanche, which builds a source of ionization in glow discharge at low pressures. Last has decisive significance to understand the hollow cathode discharge configuration and the hollow cathode effect.</summary>

    <summary>We demonstrate a general three-dimensional semiclassical model as a powerful technique for the study of correlated multi-electron escape in atoms driven by infrared laser pulses at intensities where electron-electron correlation prevails. We do so in the context of triple ionization of strongly driven Ne. We show that a drawback of other current quantum mechanical and classical models of triple ionization is that they soften the Coulomb potential of each electron with the core. The model we employ fully accounts for the singularity in the Coulomb potentials of a recolliding electron with the core and a bound electron with the core as well as for the interaction of a recolliding with a bound electron. Our model treats approximately only the interaction between bound electrons through the use of effective potentials. These effective potentials ensure that no artificial autoionization takes place as a result of the full treatment of the electron-core potential. We demonstrate the accuracy of our model by obtaining triple ionization distributions of the sum of the final electron momenta which we find to be in very good agreement with experiments. Also, we explain the main features of these momenta distributions in terms of the prevalent pathways of correlated three-electron escape in Ne. We also show that the different ionization pathways prevailing in three-electron escape in strongly driven Ne versus Ar give rise to different momenta distributions in these two atoms.</summary>

    <title>Triple ionization and "frustrated" triple ionization in triatomic molecules driven by intense laser fields</title>

    <summary>We formulate a three-dimensional semi-classical model to treat three-electron escape dynamics in a strongly-driven linear triatomic molecule, HeH$_{2}^{+}$. Our model includes the Coulomb singularities. Hence, to avoid unphysical autoionization, we employ two criteria to switch off the Coulomb repulsive force between two bound electrons and switch it on when the motion of one electron is mostly determined by the laser field. We investigate triple and "frustrated" triple ionization. In the latter process two electrons escape while one electron remains bound in a Rydberg state. We find that two pathways prevail in "frustrated" triple ionization, as in "frustrated" double ionization. We also find that the electron that remains in a Rydberg state is more likely to be attached to He$^{2+}$ compared to H$^{+}$. Our results indicate that in triple and "frustrated" triple ionization electronic correlation is weak. Moreover, we compute the sum of the kinetic energies as well as the angular patterns of the final ion fragments in triple and "frustrated" triple ionization. These patterns suggest that the fragmenting molecule deviates from its initial linear configuration.</summary>
