    <summary>In a topological insulator (TI) the character of electron transport varies from insulating in the interior of the material to metallic near its surface. Unlike, however, ordinary metals, conducting surface states in TIs are topologically protected and characterized by spin helicity whereby the direction of the electron spin is locked to the momentum direction. In this paper we review selected topics regarding recent theoretical and experimental work on electron transport and related phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) TIs. The review provides a focused introductory discussion of the quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells as well as transport properties of 3DTIs such as surface weak antilocalization, the half-integer quantum Hall effect, s + p-wave induced superconductivity, superconducting Klein tunneling, topological Andreev bound states and related Majorana midgap states. These properties of TIs are of practical interest, guiding the search for the routes towards topological spin electronics.</summary>

    <title>Superconducting band stabilizing superconductivity in MgB2</title>

    <summary>  It is shown that the superconducting intermetallic compound MgB2 possesses a narrow, partly filled "superconducting band" with Wannier functions of special symmetry in its band structure. This result corroborates previous observations about the band structures of numerous superconductors and non-superconductors showing that evidently superconductivity is always connected with such superconducting bands. These findings are interpreted in the framework of a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model. Within this new group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow superconducting bands. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconducting band is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a conventional low-Tc or a high-Tc superconductor. This interpretation provides the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.</summary>

    <title>Density functional study of FeS, FeSe and FeTe: Electronic structure, magnetism, phonons and superconductivity</title>

    <summary>  We report density functional calculations of the electronic structure, Fermi surface, phonon spectrum, magnetism and electron-phonon coupling for the superconducting phase FeSe, as well as the related compounds FeS and FeTe. We find that the Fermi surface structure of these compounds is very similar to that of the Fe-As based superconductors, with cylindrical electron sections at the zone corner, cylindrical hole surface sections, and depending on the compound, other small hole sections at the zone center. As in the Fe-As based materials, these surfaces are separated by a 2D nesting vector at ($π$,$π$). The density of states, nesting and Fermi surface size increase going from FeSe to FeTe. Both FeSe and FeTe show spin density wave ground states, while FeS is close to an instability. In a scenario where superconductivity is mediated by spin fluctuations at the SDW nesting vector, the strongest superconductor in this series would be doped FeTe.</summary>
