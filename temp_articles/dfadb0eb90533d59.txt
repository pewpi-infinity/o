    <summary>The control over impurities like hydrogen and oxygen is of key importance in nitride-based semiconducting due to their unrivaled applicability in optoelectronics and high power/high frequency electronics. Therefore, it is desirable to continue the research on its diffusion and segregation in semiconductor materials. In this work, we report on a first observation on hydrogen outdiffusion from bulk crystalline gallium nitride. The extent of the hydrogen diffusion is established by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Analysis of characteristic hydrogen profile in GaN grown using ammonothermal method, led to the determination of the hydrogen diffusion coefficient at the temperature of 1045C - a standard growth temperature for HVPE (halide vapor phase epitaxy) method.</summary>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>

    <title>Charge-induced effects on the structure and properties of silane and disilane derivatives</title>

    <summary>  Using ab-initio electronic structure methods we have investigated the ground state structures and properties of neutral and charged SiH$_{m}$(m=1-4) and Si$_{2}$H$_{n}$(n=1-6) clusters which are produced in the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process used in the preparation of hydrogenated amorphous silicon({\it{a}}-Si:H). Our results show that charging a neutral cluster distorts it and the distortion mainly occurs through the orientation of Si-H bond. We attribute structural changes in the charged clusters to electrostatic repulsion between the bonded and non-bonded electrons. We find that in addition to the usual Si-H bond, hydrogen atoms form Si-H-H and Si-H-Si bonds in some clusters. The vibrations of
 Si-H, Si-Si, Si-H-Si bond stretching modes show that the frequencies are shifted significantly upon charging. The frequency shifts in the charged clusters are consistent with their bond length variations. We discuss the fragmentation pathways of silane into binary products and the role of fragmented silane radicals in the cluster formation and {\it{a}}-Si:H film deposition process.</summary>
