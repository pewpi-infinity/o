    <summary>We report measurements of the ion velocity distribution in an ultracold neutral plasma derived from a dense, cold Rydberg gas in a MOT. The Rydberg atoms are excited using a resonant two-step excitation pathway with lasers of 4 ns duration. The plasma forms spontaneously and rapidly. The rms width of the ion velocity distribution is determined by measuring laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of the ions. The measured excitation efficiency is compared with a Monte-Carlo wavefunction calculation, and significant differences are observed. We discuss the conditions for blockaded Rydberg excitation and the subsequent spatial ordering of Rydberg atom domains. While the blockade interaction is greater than the Rabi frequency in portions of the atomic sample, no evidence for spatial ordering is observed.</summary>

    <title>Stabilization method with Relativistic Configuration-interaction applied to two-electron resonances</title>

    <summary>We applied a relativistic configuration-interaction (CI) framework to the stabilization method as an approach for obtaining the autoionization resonance structure of heliumlike ions. In this method, the ion is confined within an impenetrable spherical cavity, the size of which determines the radial space available for electron wavefunctions and electron-electron interactions. By varying the size of the cavity, one can obtain the autoionization resonance position and width. The applicability of this method is tested on the resonances of He atom while comparing with benchmark data available in the literature. The present method is further applied to the determination of the resonance structure of heliumlike uranium ion, where a relativistic framework is mandatory. In the strong-confinement region, the present method can be useful to simulate the properties of an atom or ion under extreme pressure. An exemplary application of the present method to determine the structure of ions embedded in a dense plasma environment is briefly discussed.</summary>

    <title>Pseudo-Resonance and Energy Band Gap in Plasmonic Crystals</title>
    <updated>2019-01-10T13:59:46Z</updated>

    <summary>In this paper, using the generalized coupled pseudoforce model with driving elements, we develop a method to study the plasmon excitations and energy band structure in a plasmonic crystal. It is shown that the presence of the periodic ion core potential leads to pseudo-resonance condition in the plasmon wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles, quite analogous to the frequency resonance, leading to the gap formation in the energy dispersion profiles. It is found that the dual length scale character of plasmon excitations lead to occurrence of a critical value of $a_c=2πλ_p$ for the lattice constant ($λ_p$ being the plasmon wavelength) above and below which the energy band structure of plasmonic crystals becomes substantially different. It is also found that energy band gap positions of parabolic free electron energy dispersion relation are slightly higher compared to that of the plasmon excitations. Here based on the plasmon definition and due to the dual length scale character of plasmons compared to that of single electrons, we provide a simplified interpretation of the wave-particle duality in quantum physics and provide the length scale regime in which both wave and particle properties can be simultaneously examined in a single experiment, where, the complementarity principle breaks down. However, the dual characteristics of electron-plasmon coupled excitations, quite analogous to starling murmuration phenomenon, strongly suggests that the long south de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave of electron is nothing but the plasmon itself. The wavefunction and electrostatic potential solution for a one dimensional plasmonic lattice with a generalized periodic potential is also derived in this research.</summary>
