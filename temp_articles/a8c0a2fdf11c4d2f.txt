    <summary>Electron Spin Resonance-Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (ESR-STM) of C60 radical ion on graphene is a first demonstration on radical ions. ESR-STM signal at g=2.00 was measured in accordance with macroscopic ESR of fullerene radical ion. The ESR-STM signal was bias voltage dependent, as it reflects the charge state of the molecule. The signal appears in the bias voltage which enables the ionization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (creation of radical anion) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO (creation of a radical cation) of the C60 molecule when it deposited on graphene.
  The linewidth provides information on the lifetime of the free radical. In several experiments, a 13C hyperfine splitting was observed, and a change in the phase of the ESR-STM peak as a function of the speed of the magnetic field sweep was changed. This might be used to provide information on the relaxation times of the molecules. In parallel, ESR-STM signal at g=1.6 was ascribed to Tungsten oxide (W5+) at the tip apex, which is not bias voltage dependent.
  The ability of ESR-STM to explore non paramagnetic molecules, significantly broadens the scope of this technique.</summary>

    <summary>Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) sols have been synthesized from SnCl2.2H2O precursor solution by applying two different processing conditions. The prepared sols were then deposited on UV-Ozone treated quartz and soda lime glass (SLG) substrates by spin coating. The as-synthesized film was soft-baked at about 100 deg. C. for 10 min. This process was repeated five times to get a compact film, followed by air-annealing at 250 deg. C. for 2 hours. The pristine and annealed films were characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, Grazing Incident X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The effect of the substrate surface was investigated by measuring the contact angles with De-Ionized (DI) water. UV-Ozone treatment of substrate provides a cleaner surface to grow a homogeneous film. The electrical resistivity of annealed thin films was carried out by a four-point-collinear probe employing the current reversal technique and found in the range of approx. 2x10^3 to 3x10^3 Ohm-cm. Film thickness was found in the range of approx. 137-285 nm, measured by a stylus profilometer. UV-VIs-NIR Transmission data revealed that all the thin film samples showed maximum (82-89) % transmission in the visible range. The optical bandgap of the thin films was estimated to be approx. 3.75-4.00 eV and approx. 3.78-4.35 eV for the films grown on SLG and quartz substrates, respectively.</summary>

    <title>Electron paramagnetic resonance of alkali metal atoms and dimers on ultrathin MgO</title>

    <summary>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can provide unique insight into the chemical structure and magnetic properties of dopants in oxide and semiconducting materials that are of interest for applications in electronics, catalysis, and quantum sensing. Here, we demonstrate that EPR in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) allows for probing the bonding and charge state of alkali metal atoms on an ultrathin magnesium oxide layer on a Ag substrate. We observe a magnetic moment of $1μ_\mathrm{B}$ for Li$_2$, LiNa, and Na$_2$ dimers corresponding to spin radicals with a charge state of $+1e$. Single alkali atoms have the same charge state and no magnetic moment. The ionization of the adsorbates is attributed to charge transfer through the oxide to the metal substrate. Our work highlights the potential of EPR-STM to provide insight into dopant atoms that are relevant for the control of the electrical properties of surfaces and nanodevices.</summary>
