    <summary>The quantum behavior of light nuclei and other particles in materials challenges classical intuition and introduces novel phenomena. Here we demonstrate that muon spin spectroscopy ( $μ$SR) is a powerful tool for exploring the quantum effects of light particles, such as the muon, in condensed matter. The muon's quantum nature is profoundly influenced by the surrounding, offering a unique probe for understanding the role of light atoms and their role in shaping local electronic environments. In Zn-barlowite, a candidate quantum spin liquid, we show that standard density functional theory (DFT) methods, which treat the muon as a classical point-like particle, fail to capture its strong quantum anharmonic effects. Only by modeling the muon as a spatially extended quantum particle, thus accounting for the anharmonicity, can the experimental $μ$SR data be understood. This approach not only improves the interpretation of $μ$SR results but also opens the door to studying the quantum effects of other light particles, like hydrogen and lithium nuclei, which can greatly influence material properties.</summary>

    <summary>  A positive muon is a spin-1/2 particle. Beams of muons with all their spins polarized can be prepared and subsequently implanted in various types of condensed matter. The subsequent precession and relaxation of their spins can then be used to investigate a variety of static and dynamic effects in a sample and hence to deduce properties concerning magnetism, superconductivity and molecular dynamics. Though strictly a lepton, and behaving essentially like a heavy electron, it is convenient to think of a muon as a light proton, and it is often found with a captured electron in a hydrogen-like atom known as muonium. This article outlines the principles of various experimental techniques which involve implanted muons and describes some recent applications. The use of muons in condensed matter physics has shed new light on subjects as diverse as passivation in semiconductors, frustrated spin systems, vortex lattice melting, and quantum diffusion of light particles.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen Diffusion and Trapping in α-Iron: The Role of Quantum and Anharmonic Fluctuations</title>

    <summary>We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic α-iron, taking account of the quantum fluctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diffusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation of diffusivity and we find that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by finite temperature effects and about half of these arise from quantum proton fluctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.</summary>
