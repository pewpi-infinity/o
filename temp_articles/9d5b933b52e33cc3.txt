    <summary>We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge \(Q\), features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \(r_\ast = \frac{2|Q|}π\) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle's charge-to-mass ratio \(\frac{|q|}{m}\). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\(r \gg |Q|\)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \(r_\ast\), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the canonical thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.</summary>

    <title>Relativistic effects on information measures for hydrogen-like atoms</title>

    <summary>  Position and momentum information measures are evaluated for the ground state of the \emph{relativistic} hydrogen-like atoms. Consequences of the fact that the radial momentum operator is not self-adjoint are explicitly studied, exhibiting fundamental shortcomings of the conventional uncertainty measures in terms of the radial position and momentum variances. The Shannon and Rényi entropies, the Fisher information measure, as well as several related information measures, are considered as viable alternatives. Detailed results on the onset of relativistic effects for low nuclear charges, and on the extreme relativistic limit, are presented. The relativistic position density decays exponentially at large $r$, but is singular at the origin. Correspondingly, the momentum density decays as an inverse power of $p$. Both features yield divergent Rényi entropies away from a finite vicinity of the Shannon entropy. While the position space information measures can be evaluated analytically for both the nonrelativistic and the relativistic hydrogen atom, this is not the case for the relativistic momentum space. Some of the results allow interesting insight into the significance of recently evaluated Dirac-Fock vs. Hartree-Fock complexity measures for many-electron neutral atoms.</summary>

    <title>Atomic Structure in Black Hole</title>

    <summary>  We propose that any black hole has atomic structure in its inside and has no horizon as a model of black holes. Our proposal is founded on a mean field approximation of gravity. The structure of our model consists of a (charged) singularity at the center and quantum fluctuations of fields around the singularity, namely, it is quite similar to that of atoms. Any properties of black holes, e.g. entropy, can be explained by the model. The model naturally quantizes black holes. In particular, we find the minimum black hole, whose structure is similar to that of the hydrogen atom and whose Schwarzschild radius is approximately 1.1287 times the Planck length. Our approach is conceptually similar to the Bohr's model of the atomic structure, and the concept of the minimum Schwarzschild radius is similar to that of the Bohr radius. The model predicts that black holes carry baryon number, and the baryon number is rapidly violated. This baryon number violation can be used as verification of the model.</summary>
