    <summary>The dispersion relation of plasma and plasma-dielectric photonic multilayer structures is approached in terms of a one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulation. For several plasma-dielectric configurations, the system response is obtained using a pulsed excitation and a subsequent two-dimensional frequency analysis. It is first shown that the dispersion relation of a single, homogeneous plasma slab is well described by the cold-plasma model even at low pressures of 1 Pa. The study is extended to the simulation of plasma photonic crystals with a variety of configurations, based on the work of Hojo and Mase [J. Plasma Fusion Res. 80, 89 (2004)]. Considering a one-dimensional plasma photonic crystal made from alternating layers of dielectric and homogeneous plasma slabs, it is shown that the assumption of a cold-plasma description is well justified also in this case. Moreover, in this work the results are reformatted and analyzed in a band diagram representation, in particular based on the lattice constant $a$. Based on these considerations a scaling invariant representation is presented, utilizing a generalized set of parameters. The study is completed with an exemplary comparison of three plasma-dielectric photonic crystal configurations and their corresponding band diagrams.</summary>

    <summary>The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas in a state where a global mode has been established or is in turbulence, are of theoretical and experimental interest in thermonuclear fusion research. Interpreting experimental results, as well as predicting plasma behavior requires the numerical solutions of the underlying physics, that is, the numerical solution of Maxwell equations under various initial conditions and, under the circumstances, complex boundary conditions. Casting, the underlying equations in a coordinate free form that exploits the symmetries and the conserved quantities in a form that can easily encompass a variety of initial and boundary conditions is of tantamount importance. Pursuing this task we utilize the advantages the Clifford Algebras can possibly provide. For simplicity we deal with a cold multi-species lossless magnetized plasma. The formulation renders a Dirac type evolution equation for am augmented state that consists of the electric and magnetic field bivectors as well as the polarizations and their associated currents for each species. This evolution equation can be dealt with a general spatial lattice disretization scheme. The evolution operator that dictates the temporal advancement of the state is Hermitian. This formulation is computationally simpler whatever the application could be. However, small wavelength capabilities (on the Debye length scale) for spatially large systems (magnetic confinement devices) is questionable even for conventional super-computers. However, the formulation provided in this work it is entirely suitable and it can be directly transferred in a quantum computer. It is shown that the simplified problem in the present work could be suitable for contemporary rudimentary quantum computers.</summary>

    <summary>Electromagnetic waves are an inherent part of all plasmas -- laboratory fusion plasmas or astrophysical plasmas. The conventional methods for studying properties of electromagnetic waves rely on discretization of Maxwell equations suitable for implementing on classical, present day, computers. The traditional methodology is not efficient for quantum computing implementation -- a future computational source offering a tantalizing possibility of enormous speed up and a significant reduction in computational cost. This paper addresses two topics relevant to implementing Maxwell equations on a quantum computer. The first is on formulating a quantum Schrodinger representation of Maxwell equations for wave propagation in a cold, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma. This representation admits unitary, energy preserving, evolution and conveniently lends itself to appropriate discretization for a quantum computer. Riding on the coattails of these results, the second topic is on developing a sequence of unitary operators which form the basis for a qubit lattice algorithm (QLA). The QLA, suitable for quantum computers, can be implemented and tested on existing classical computers for accuracy as well as scaling of computational time with the number of available processors. In order to illustrate the QLA for Maxwell equations, results are presented from a time evolving, full wave simulation of propagation and scattering of an electromagnetic wave packet by non-dispersive dielectric medium localized in space.</summary>
