    <summary>  Position and momentum information measures are evaluated for the ground state of the \emph{relativistic} hydrogen-like atoms. Consequences of the fact that the radial momentum operator is not self-adjoint are explicitly studied, exhibiting fundamental shortcomings of the conventional uncertainty measures in terms of the radial position and momentum variances. The Shannon and Rényi entropies, the Fisher information measure, as well as several related information measures, are considered as viable alternatives. Detailed results on the onset of relativistic effects for low nuclear charges, and on the extreme relativistic limit, are presented. The relativistic position density decays exponentially at large $r$, but is singular at the origin. Correspondingly, the momentum density decays as an inverse power of $p$. Both features yield divergent Rényi entropies away from a finite vicinity of the Shannon entropy. While the position space information measures can be evaluated analytically for both the nonrelativistic and the relativistic hydrogen atom, this is not the case for the relativistic momentum space. Some of the results allow interesting insight into the significance of recently evaluated Dirac-Fock vs. Hartree-Fock complexity measures for many-electron neutral atoms.</summary>

    <summary>By applying Rosen's quantization approach to the historical Oppenheimer and Snyder gravitational collapse and by setting the constraints for the formation of the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH), in a previous paper [1] two of the Authors (CC and FF) found the gravitational potential, the Schrodinger equation, the solution for the energy levels, the area quantum and the quantum representation of the ground state at the Planck scale of the SBH. Such results are consistent with previous ones in the literature. It was also shown that the traditional classical singularity in the core of the SBH is replaced by a quantum oscillator describing a non-singular two-particle system where the two components, named the "nucleus" and the "electron", strongly interact with each other through a quantum gravitational interaction. In agreement with the de Broglie hypothesis, the "electron" is interpreted in terms of the quantum oscillations of the BH horizon. In other words, the SBH should be the gravitational analogous of the hydrogen atom. In this paper, it is shown that these results allow us to compute the SBH entropy as a function of the BH principal quantum number in terms of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and three sub-leading corrections. In addition, the coefficient of the formula of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is reduced to a quarter of the traditional value. Then, it is shown that, by performing a correct rescaling of the energy levels, the semi-classical Bohr-like approach to BH quantum physics, previously developed by one of the Authors (CC), is consistent with the obtained results for large values of the BH principal quantum number. After this, Hawking radiation will be analysed by discussing its connection with the BH quantum structure. Finally, it is shown that the time evolution of the above mentioned system solves the BH information paradox.</summary>
