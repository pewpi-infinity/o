    <summary>Momentum and energy conservation are fundamental tenets of physics, that valid physical theories have to satisfy. In the reversible transformation between superconducting and normal phases in the presence of a magnetic field, the mechanical momentum of the supercurrent has to be transferred to the body as a whole and vice versa, the kinetic energy of the supercurrent stays in the electronic degrees of freedom, and no energy is dissipated nor entropy is generated in the process. We argue on general grounds that to explain these processes it is necessary that the electromagnetic field mediates the transfer of momentum between electrons and the body as a whole, and this requires that when the phase boundary between normal and superconducting phases is displaced, a flow and counterflow of charge occurs in direction perpendicular to the phase boundary. This flow and counterflow does not occur according to the conventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity, therefore we argue that within BCS-London theory the Meissner transition is a `forbidden transition'. Furthermore, to explain the phase transformation in a way that is consistent with the experimental observations requires that (i) the wavefunction $and$ charge distribution of superconducting electrons near the phase boundary extend into the normal phase, and (ii) that the charge carriers in the normal state have hole-like character. The conventional theory of superconductivity does not have these physical elements, the theory of hole superconductivity does.</summary>

    <summary>The discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ -- a transition metal (TM) oxide that is both isostructural and isoelectronic to cuprate superconductors -- has lead to renewed enthusiasm in the hope of understanding the origin of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we investigate the electron-removal states in infinite-layered Ni$^{1+}$ oxide, NdNiO$_2$, which mimics hole-doping, with the state-of-the-art many-body multireference quantum chemistry methods. From the analysis of the many-body wavefunction, we find that the hole-doped $d^8$ ground state of NdNiO$_2$ is very different from the $d^8$ ground state in isostructural cuprate analog CaCuO$_2$, although the parent $d^9$ ground states are for the most part identical. We show that the doped hole in NdNiO$_2$ mainly localizes on the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital to form a closed-shell singlet, and this singlet configuration contributes to $\sim$40% of the wavefunction. In contrast, in CaCuO$_2$ the Zhang-Rice singlet configurations contribute to $\sim$65% of the wavefunction. With the help of the quantum information concept of entanglement entropy, we quantify the different types of electronic correlations in the nickelate and cuprate compounds and find that the dynamic radial-type correlations within the Ni $d$ manifold are persistent in hole-doped NdNiO$_2$. As a result, the $d^8$ multiplet effects are stronger and the additional hole foot-print is more three-dimensional in NdNiO$_2$. Our analysis shows that the most commonly used three-band Hubbard model employed to express the doped scenario in cuprates represents $\sim$90% of the $d^8$ wavefunction for CaCuO$_2$, but such a model grossly approximates the $d^8$ wavefunction for NdNiO$_2$ as it only stands for $\sim$60% of the wavefunction.</summary>

    <summary>  We consider the Cooper-problem on a lattice model including onsite and near-neighbor interactions. Expanding the interaction in basis functions for the irreducible representation for the point group $C_{4v}$ yields a classification of the symmetry of the Cooper-pair wave function, which we calculate in real-space. A change of symmetry upon doping, from s-wave at low filling fractions, to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ at higher filling fractions, is found. Fermi-surface details are thus important for the symmetry of the superconducting wave function. Symmetry forbids mixing of s-wave and d-wave symmetry in the Cooper-pair wavefunction on a square lattice, unless accidental degeneracies occur. This conclusion also holds for the selfconsistent treatment of the many-body problem, at the critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$, we find temperatures which are not critical points, where new superconducting channels open up in the order parameter due to bifurcations in the solutions of the nonlinear gap-equation. We calculate the free energy, entropy, coherence length, critical magnetic fields, and Ginzburg-Landau parameter $κ$. The model is of the extreme type-II variety. At the temperatures where subdominant channels condense, we find cusps in the internal energy and entropy, as well as as BCS-like discontinuities in the specific heat. The specific heat anomalies are however weaker than at the true superconducting critical point, and argued to be of a different nature.</summary>
