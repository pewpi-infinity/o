    <summary>We report on a quantum electrodynamic (QED) investigation of the interaction between a ground state atom with another atom in an excited state. General expressions, applicable to any atom, are indicated for the long-range tails which are due to virtual resonant emission and absorption into and from vacuum modes whose frequency equals the transition frequency to available lower-lying atomic states. For identical atoms, one of which is in an excited state, we also discuss the mixing term which depends on the symmetry of the two-atom wave function (these evolve into either the gerade or the ungerade state for close approach), and we include all nonresonant states in our rigorous QED treatment. In order to illustrate the findings, we analyze the fine-structure resolved van der Waals interaction for nD-1S hydrogen interactions with n=8,10,12 and find surprisingly large numerical coefficients.</summary>

    <summary>  Radio pulsars emit regular bursts of radio radiation that propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM), the tenuous gas and plasma between the stars. Previously known dispersive properties of the ISM cause low frequency pulses to be delayed in time with respect to high frequency ones. This effect can be explained by the presence of free electrons in the medium. The ISM also contains neutral hydrogen which has a well known resonance at 1420.4 MHz. Electro-magnetic theory predicts that at such a resonance, the induced dispersive effects will be drastically different from those of the free electrons. Pulses traveling through a cloud of neutral hydrogen should undergo "anomalous dispersion", which causes the group velocity of the medium to be larger than the speed of light in vacuum. This superluminal group velocity causes pulses containing frequencies near the resonance to arrive earlier in time with respect to other pulses. Hence, these pulses appear to travel faster than light. This phenomenon is caused by an interplay between the time scales present in the pulse and the time scales present in the medium. Although counter-intuitive, it does not violate the laws of special relativity. Here, we present Arecibo observations of the radio pulsar PSR B1937+21 that show clear evidence of anomalous dispersion. Though this effect is known in laboratory physics, this is the first time it has been directly observed in an astrophysical context, and it has the potential to be a useful tool for studying the properties of neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy.</summary>

    <title>Multiphysics Simulation and First Prototype Development of a Microwave Plasma System for Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) Applications</title>

    <summary>With the aid of COMSOL multiphysics simulations, a compact microwave plasma reactor operated at 2.45 GHz frequency has been designed for diamond film deposition. The reactor consists of a cylindrical cavity that resonates in the fundamental mode $TM_{01p}$ with a longitudinal field variation (p = 1). Investigations on microwave electric field and hydrogen $(H_{2})$ plasma characteristics inside the microwave plasma cavity have been carried out, which assisted in the resonant cavity optimizations. The new reactor design includes a unique antenna structure which facilitates better thermal management and gas inlet arrangement. Parametric analysis of the effect of increase in microwave power, gas pressure and synergistic effects of power and pressure variations on the $H_{2}$ plasma characteristics such as electron density, gas temperature, and atomic hydrogen density have been performed computationally to estimate the optimize reactor operating conditions. Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively. Preliminary experimental validation which includes vacuum integrity and $H_{2}$ plasma ignition tests inside the cavity are also reported.</summary>
