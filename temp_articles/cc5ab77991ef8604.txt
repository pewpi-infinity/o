    <summary>The 2015 Planck data release has placed tight constraints on the class of in ationary models allowed. The current best fit region favors concave downwards in ationary potentials, since they produce a suppressed tensor to scalar index ratio r. Concave downward potentials have a negative curvature V"&lt;0, therefore a tachyonic mass square that drives fluctuations. Furthermore, their use can become problematic if the field rolls in a part of the potential away from the extrema, since the semiclassical approximation of quantum cosmology, used for deriving the most probable wavefunction of the universe from the landscape and for addressing the quantum to classical transition, breaks down away from the steepest descent region. We here propose a way of dealing with such potentials by inverting the metric signature and solving for the wavefunction of the universe in the Euclidean sector. This method allows us to extend our theory of the origin of the universe from a quantum multiverse, to a more general class of concave inflationary potentials where a straightforward application of the semiclassical approximation fails. The work here completes the derivation of modifications to the Newtonian potential and to the inflationary potential, which originate from the quantum entanglement of our universe with all others in the quantum landscape multiverse, leading to predictions of observational signatures for both types of in ationary models, concave and convex potentials.</summary>

    <summary>  Motivated by the Randall-Sundrum brane-world scenario, we discuss the classical and quantum dynamics of a (d+1)-dimensional boundary wall between a pair of (d+2)-dimensional topological Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. We assume there are quite general -- but not completely arbitrary -- matter fields living on the boundary ``brane universe'' and its geometry is that of an Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The effective action governing the model in the mini-superspace approximation is derived. We find that the presence of black hole horizons in the bulk gives rise to a complex action for certain classically allowed brane configurations, but that the imaginary contribution plays no role in the equations of motion. Classical and instanton brane trajectories are examined in general and for special cases, and we find a subset of configuration space that is not allowed at the classical or semi-classical level; these correspond to spacelike branes carrying tachyonic matter. The Hamiltonization and Dirac quantization of the model is then performed for the general case; the latter involves the manipulation of the Hamiltonian constraint before it is transformed into an operator that annihilates physical state vectors. The ensuing covariant Wheeler-DeWitt equation is examined at the semi-classical level, and we consider the possible localization of the brane universe's wavefunction away from the cosmological singularity. This is easier to achieve for branes with low density and/or spherical spatial sections.</summary>

    <title>On a semi-classical limit of loop space quantum mechanics</title>

    <summary>Following earlier work, we view two dimensional non-linear sigma model with target space $\cM$ as a single particle relativistic quantum mechanics in the corresponding free loop space $\cLM$. In a natural semi-classical limit ($\hbar=α' \to 0$) of this model the wavefunction localizes on the submanifold of vanishing loops which is isomorphic to $\cM$. One would expect that the relevant semi-classical expansion should be related to the tubular expansion of the theory around the submanifold and an effective dynamics on the submanifold is obtainable using Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this work we develop a framework to carry out such an analysis at the leading order in $α'$-expansion. In particular, we show that the linearized tachyon effective equation is correctly reproduced up to divergent terms all proportional to the Ricci scalar of $\cM$. The steps leading to this result are as follows: first we define a finite dimensional analogue of the loop space quantum mechanics (LSQM) where we discuss its tubular expansion and how that is related to a semi-classical expansion of the Hamiltonian. Then we study an explicit construction of the relevant tubular neighborhood in $\cLM$ using exponential maps. Such a tubular geometry is obtained from a Riemannian structure on the tangent bundle of $\cM$ which views the zero-section as a submanifold admitting a tubular neighborhood. Using this result and exploiting an analogy with the toy model we arrive at the final result for LSQM.</summary>
