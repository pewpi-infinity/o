    <summary>  A generation of neutrino experiments have established that neutrinos mix and probably have mass. The mixing phenomenon points to processes beyond those of the Standard Model, possibly at the Grand Unification energy scale. A extensive sequence of of experiments will be required to measure precisely all the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix, culminating with the discovery and study of leptonic CP violation. As a first step, extensions of conventional pion/kaon decay beams, such as off-axis beams or low-energy super-beams, have been considered. These could yield first observations of $ν_μ\to ν_e$ transitions at the atmospheric frequency, which have not yet been observed, and a first measurement of $θ_{13}$. Experiments with much better flux control can be envisaged if the neutrinos are obtained from the decays of stored particles. One such possibility is the concept of beta beams provided by the decays of radioactive nuclei, that has been developed within the context of these studies. These would provide a pure (anti-)electron-neutrino beam of a few hundred MeV, and beautiful complementarity with a high-intensity, low-energy conventional beam, enabling experimental probes of T violation as well as CP violation. Ultimately, a definitive and complete set of measurements would offered by a Neutrino Factory based on a muon storage ring. This powerful machine offers the largest reach for CP violation, even for very small values of $θ_{13}$.</summary>

    <title>Elastic scattering of a muon neutrino by an electron in the presence of a circularly polarized laser field</title>

    <summary>In view of the great contribution of neutrino-electron scattering to the deep understanding of electroweak interactions, we focus in this paper on the study of elastic scattering of a muon neutrino by an electron $(e^{-}ν_μ\rightarrow e^{-}ν_μ)$ in the presence of a circularly polarized electromagnetic field. We perform our theoretical calculation within the framework of Fermi theory using the exact wave functions of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. The expression of the differential cross section (DCS) for this process is obtained analytically in the absence and presence of the laser field. The effect of the field strength and frequency on the exchange of photons as well as on the DCS is presented and analyzed. Massive neutrino effects are also included and discussed. This study, added to the previous ones, will significantly enrich our knowledge in fundamental physics.</summary>

    <summary>The (International Design Report) IDR neutrino factory scenario for capture, bunching, phase-energy rotation and initial cooling of micro's produced from a proton source target is explored. It requires a drift section from the target, a bunching section and a -E rotation section leading into the cooling channel. The rf frequency changes along the bunching and rotation transport in order to form the 's into a train of equal-energy bunches suitable for cooling and acceleration. Optimization and variations are discussed. An important concern is rf limitations within the focusing magnetic fields, mitigation procedures are described. The method can be extended to provide muons for a micro+-micro &lt; Collider, variations toward optimizing that extension are discussed.</summary>
