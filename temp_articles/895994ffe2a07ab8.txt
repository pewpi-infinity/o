    <summary>Neutrino physics is a forefront topic of today's research. Large detectors installed underground study neutrino properties using neutrino beams from muons decaying in flight. DAEdALUS looks at neutrinos from stopped muons, "decay at rest" (DAR) neutrinos. The DAR neutrino spectrum has effectively no electron antineutrinos (essentially all pi- are absorbed), so a detector with free protons is sensitive to appearance of nu-e-bar oscillating from nu-mu-bar via inverse-beta-decay (IBD). Oscillations are studied using sources relatively near the detector, but which explore the same physics as the high-energy neutrino beams from Long Baseline experiments. As the DAR spectrum is fixed, the baseline is varied: plans call for 3 accelerator-based neutrino sources at 1.5, 8 and 20 km with staggered beam-on times. Compact, cost-effective superconducting ring cyclotrons accelerating molecular hydrogen ions (H2+) to 800 MeV/n with stripping extraction are being designed by L. Calabretta and his group. This revolutionary design could find application in many ADS-related fields.</summary>

    <title>Cooling of Quark Stars in the Color Superconductive Phase: Effect of Photons from Glueball decay</title>

    <summary>  The cooling history of a quark star in the color superconductive phase is investigated. Here we specifically focus on the 2-flavour color (2SC) phase where novel process of photon generation via glueball (GLB) decay have been already investigated (Ouyed &amp; Sannino 2001). The picture we present here can in principle be generalized to quark stars entering a superconductive phase where similar photon generation mechanisms are at play. As much as 10^{45}-10^{47} erg of energy is provided by the GLB decay in the 2SC phase. The generated photons slowly diffuse out of the quark star keeping it hot and radiating as a black-body (with possibly a Wien spectrum in gamma-rays) for millions of years. We discuss hot radio-quiet isolated neutron stars in our picture (such as RX J185635-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125) and argue that their nearly blackbody spectra (with a few broad features) and their remarkably tiny hydrogen atmosphere are indications that these might be quark stars in the color superconductive phase where some sort of photon generation mechanism (reminiscent of the GLB decay) has taken place. Fits to observed data of cooling compact stars favor models with superconductive gaps of Delta_2SC = 15-35 MeV and densities rho_2SC=(2.5-3.0)rho_N (rho_N being the nuclear matter saturation density) for quark matter in the 2SC phase. If correct, our model combined with more observations of isolated compact stars could provide vital information to studies of quark matter and its exotic phases.</summary>
