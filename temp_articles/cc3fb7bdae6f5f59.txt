    <summary>The detection, removal and reduction of hydrogen peroxide is of significant importance for its increasing application in the areas of environment, food, electrochemistry and clinical laboratory. Herein the dissociative adsorption behavior of hydrogen peroxide on ultrathin magnesia (001) films deposited on transition metal is uncovered for the first time by employing periodic density-functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. The hydrogen peroxide is dissociated smoothly and reduced to surface hydroxyls on MgO(001)/TM, and the dissociative adsorption energies of all the considered fragmentation configurations are substantially negative, demonstrating dissociation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide on MgO(001)/TM is thermodynamically favorable. The dissociative adsorption energy decreases monotonously with increasing film thickness, demonstrating the lower reactivity of thick oxide films. Moreover, we examined the suitability of several transition metal slabs (molybdenum, silver, vanadium, tungsten and gold) combined with magnesia for splitting hydrogen peroxide. The dissociative adsorption energies enhance when the lattice constants of substrate slabs increase, indicating the chemisorption strength can be tuned by category of metal slabs as well as thickness of oxide film. The mechanism of reactivity enhancement for energetically and dynamically favorable decomposition of hydrogen peroxide on supported magnesia is elucidated by characterizing the geometric structures and electronic properties. The fragmentation and reduction of diethyl peroxide and peroxyacetone are also studied to reveal the catalytic activity of ultrathin magnesia toward splitting organic peroxides. The results are wished to provide useful clue for detecting and reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides by employing oxide-metal hybrid nanostructure.</summary>

    <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on Defective and Strained Black Bismuth (III) Oxide</title>

    <summary>Bismuth (III) oxide (Bi2O3) has been highly studied as a photocatalyst for green hydrogen production due to its low band gap, yet its efficiency requires enhancement. This study synthesizes a defective and strained black Bi2O3 by severe straining under high pressure, via a high-pressure torsion method, to improve its photocatalytic hydrogen production. The material rich in oxygen vacancies exhibits a ten-fold improvement in water splitting with excellent cycling stability. Such improvement is due to improved light absorption, narrowing band gap and reduced irradiative electron-hole recombination. Moreover, the valence band bottom energy positively increases by straining leading to a high overpotential for hydrogen production. This research highlights the potential of vacancies and lattice strain in developing dopant-free active catalysts for water splitting.</summary>

    <title>Defect engineering over anisotropic brookite towards substrate-specific photo-oxidation of alcohols</title>

    <summary>Generally adopted design strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic activity are aimed at tuning properties such as the visible light response, the exposed crystal facets, and the nanocrystal shape. Here, we present a different approach for designing efficient photocatalysts displaying a substrate-specific reactivity upon defect engineering. The defective anisotropic brookite TiO2 photocatalyst functionalized with Pt nanocrystals are tested for alcohol photoreforming showing up to an 11-fold increase in methanol oxidation rate, compared to the unreduced one, whilst presenting much lower ethanol or isopropanol specific oxidation rates. We demonstrate that the alcohol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions are tightly related, and when the substrate-specific alcohol oxidation ability is increased, the hydrogen evolution is significantly boosted. The reduced anisotropic brookite shows up to twenty-six-fold higher specific photoactivity with respect to anatase and brookite with isotropic nanocrystals, reflecting the different type of defective catalytic sites formed depending on the TiO2 polymorph and its crystal shape. Advanced in-situ characterizations and theoretical investigations reveal that controlled engineering over oxygen vacancies and lattice strain produces large electron polarons hosting the substrate-specific active sites for alcohol photo-oxidation.</summary>
