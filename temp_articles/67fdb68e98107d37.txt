    <summary>The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</summary>

    <title>Acoustic-phonon-mediated superconductivity in moiréless graphene multilayers</title>

    <summary>We investigate the competition between acoustic-phonon-mediated superconductivity and the long-range Coulomb interaction in moiréless graphene multilayers, specifically, Bernal bilayer graphene, rhombohedral trilayer graphene, and ABCA-stacked tetralayer graphene. In these graphene multilayers, the acoustic phonons can realize, through electron-phonon coupling, both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings, and the intra-sublattice pairings ($s$-wave spin-singlet and $f$-wave spin-triplet) are the dominant channels. Our theory naturally explains the distinct recent experimental findings in Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral trilayer graphene, and we further predict existence of superconductivity in ABCA tetralayer graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the acoustic-phonon-mediated superconductivity prevails over a wide range of doping in rhombohedral trilayer graphene and ABCA tetralayer graphene while superconductivity exists only in a narrow range of doping near the Van Hove singularity in Bernal bilayer graphene. Key features of our theory are the inclusion of realistic band structures with the appropriate Van Hove singularities and Coulomb repulsion effects (the so-called "$μ^*$ effect") opposing the phonon-induced superconducting pairing. We also discuss how intervalley scatterings can suppress the spin-triplet spin-polarized superconductivity. Our work provides detailed prediction based on electron-acoustic-phonon-interaction-induced graphene superconductivity, which should be investigated in future experiments.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity in twisted multilayer graphene: a smoking gun in recent condensed matter physics</title>

    <summary>In this article, we review the recent discoveries of exotic phenomena in graphene, especially superconductivity. It has been theoretically suggested for more than one decade that superconductivity may emerge in doped graphene-based materials. For single-layer graphene, there are theoretical predictions that spin-singlet $d+id$ pairing superconductivity is present when the filling is around the Dirac point. If the Fermi level is doped to the Van Hove singularity where the density of states diverges, then unconventional superconductivity with other pairing symmetry would appear. However, the experimental perspective was a bit disappointing. Despite extensive experimental efforts, superconductivity was not found in monolayer graphene. Recently, unconventional superconductivity was found in "magic-angle" twisted bilayer graphene. Superconductivity was also found in ABC stacked trilayer graphene and other systems. In this article, we review the unique properties of superconducting states in graphene, experimentally controlling the superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, as well as a gate-tunable Mott insulator, and the superconductivity in trilayer graphene. These discoveries have attracted the attention of a large number of physicists. The study of the electronic correlated states in twisted multilayer graphene serves as a smoking gun in recent condensed matter physics.</summary>
