    <summary>The effect of supercritical charge impurities in graphene is very similar to the supercritical atomic collapses in QED for Z &gt; 137, but with a much lower critical charge. In this sense graphene can be considered as a natural testing ground for the analysis of quantum field theory vacuum instabilities. We analyze the quantum transition from subcritical to supercritical charge regimes in gapped graphene in a common framework that preserves unitarity for any value of charge impurities. In the supercritical regime it is possible to introduce boundary conditions which control the singular behavior at the impurity. We show that for subcritical charges there are also non-trivial boundary conditions which are similar to those that appear in QED for nuclei in the intermediate regime 118&lt;Z&lt;137. We analyze the behavior of the energy levels associated to the different boundary conditions. In particular, we point out the existence of new bound states in the subcritical regime which include a negative energy bound state in the attractive Coulomb regime. A remarkable property is the continuity of the energy spectral flow under variation of the impurity charge even when jumping across the critical charge transition. We also remark that the energy levels of Hydrogenoid bound states at critical values of charge impurities act as focal points of the spectral flow.</summary>

    <summary>The solutions of many issues, of the ongoing efforts to make deformed graphene a tabletop quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, are presented. A detailed explanation of the special features of curved spacetimes, originating from embedding portions of the Lobachevsky plane into $\mathbf{R}^3$, is given, and the special role of coordinates for the physical realizations in graphene, is explicitly shown, in general, and for various examples. The Rindler spacetime is reobtained, with new important differences with respect to earlier results. The de Sitter spacetime naturally emerges, for the first time, paving the way to future applications in cosmology. The role of the BTZ black hole is also briefly addressed. The singular boundary of the pseudospheres, "Hilbert horizon", is seen to be closely related to event horizon of the Rindler, de Sitter, and BTZ kind. This gives new, and stronger, arguments for the Hawking phenomenon to take place. An important geometric parameter, $c$, overlooked in earlier work, takes here its place for physical applications, and it is shown to be related to graphene's lattice spacing, $\ell$. It is shown that all surfaces of constant negative curvature, ${\cal K} = -r^{-2}$, are unified, in the limit $c/r \to 0$, where they are locally applicable to the Beltrami pseudosphere. This, and $c = \ell$, allow us a) to have a phenomenological control on the reaching of the horizon; b) to use spacetimes different than Rindler for the Hawking phenomenon; c) to approach the generic surface of the family. An improved expression for the thermal LDOS is obtained. A non-thermal term for the total LDOS is found. It takes into account: a) the peculiarities of the graphene-based Rindler spacetime; b) the finiteness of a laboratory surface; c) the optimal use of the Minkowski quantum vacuum, through the choice of this Minkowski-static boundary.</summary>

    <title>Creation of planar charged fermions in Coulomb and Aharonov-Bohm potentials</title>

    <summary>The creation of charged fermions from the vacuum by a Coulomb field in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm (AB) potential are studied in 2+1 dimensions. The process is governed by a (singular) Dirac Hamiltonian that requires the supplementary definition in order for it to be treated as a self-adjoint quantum-mechanical operator. By constructing a one-parameter self-adjoint extension of the Dirac Hamiltonian, specified by boundary conditions, we describe the (virtual bound) quasistationary states with "complex energy" emerging in an attractive Coulomb potential, derive for the first time, complex equations (depending upon the electron spin and the extension parameter) for the quasistationary state "complex energy". The constructed self-adjoint Dirac Hamiltonians in Coulomb and AB potentials are applied to provide a correct description to the low-energy electron excitations, as well as the creation of charged quasiparticles from the vacuum in graphene by the Coulomb impurity in the presence of AB potential. It is shown that the strong Coulomb field can create charged fermions for some range of the extension parameter.</summary>
