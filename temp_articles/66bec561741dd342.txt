    <summary>Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</summary>

    <title>Deformable Molecular Crystal on 2D Crystal: A New Way to Build Nanoscale Periodic Trapping Sites for Interlayer Excitons</title>

    <summary>The nanoscale moiré pattern formed at 2D transition metal dichalcogenide crystal (TMDC) heterostructures provides periodic trapping sites for excitons, which is essential for realizing various exotic phases such as artificial exciton lattices, Bose-Einstein condensates, and exciton insulators. At organic molecule/TMDC heterostructures, similar periodic potentials can be formed via other degrees of freedom. We utilize the structure deformability of a 2D molecular crystal as a degree of freedom to create a periodic nanoscale potential that can trap interlayer excitons (IXs). Specifically, two semiconducting molecules, PTCDI and PTCDA, which possess similar bandgaps and ionization potentials but form different lattice structures on MoS2, are investigated.The PTCDI lattice on MoS2 is distorted geometrically, which lifts the degeneracy of the two molecules within the crystal's unit cell. The degeneracy lifting results in a spatial variation of the molecular orbital energy, with an amplitude and periodicity of ~ 0.2 eV and ~ 2 nm, respectively. On the other hand, no such energy variation is observed in PTCDA/MoS2, where the PTCDA lattice is much less distorted. The periodic variation in molecular orbital energies provides effective trapping sites for IXs. For IXs formed at PTCDI/MoS2, rapid spatial localization of the electron in the organic layer towards the interface is observed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of these interfacial IX's traps.</summary>

    <title>Suppression of compensating native defect formation during semiconductor processing via excess carriers</title>

    <summary>In many semiconductors, compensating defects set doping limits, decrease carrier mobility, and reduce minority carrier lifetime thus limiting their utility in devices. Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic dopants may also act as their own compensation when occupying an alternate lattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during processing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation enthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge. Excess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the formation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during crystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations. Herein we develop a rigorous and general model for defect formation in the presence of steady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard quasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable for any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as chemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier concentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating centers, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the specific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and extrinsically n-type doped GaSb. The model also predicts reductions in the concentration of ionized scattering centers as well as increased mobility. While our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation in semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the concept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition.</summary>
