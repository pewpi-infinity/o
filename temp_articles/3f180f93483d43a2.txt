    <summary>It is widely agreed that studying the 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen may be our best hope for understanding the creation of the first structures during the dark ages and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This hyperfine transition occurs as a result of the spin-spin interaction between the electron and the proton in hydrogen: The energy of the parallel spins (triplet) state is greater than that of the anti-parallel spins (singlet). This transition is strongly banned, with a transition probability of $2.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ being exceedingly low. Despite its low chance, the 21 cm hyperfine transition is one of the most important tools in observational astronomy due to the abundance of hydrogen in the Universe. The relative occupation number of the ground state and the occupation number of the excited state determine the strength of the 21 cm emission or absorption. Collisions or the so-called Wouthuysen-Field effect can both excite the 21 cm line. In this article, we give a brief review of the basic physics of 21 cm emission and highlight the current main worldwide 21 cm signal experiments. We also discuss several related concepts in astronomy and cosmology with these observations.</summary>

    <title>Potential energy surfaces for electron dynamics from a model of localized Gaussian wave packets with valence-bond spin-coupling: high-harmonic generation spectra from H and He atoms</title>

    <summary>Potential energy surfaces of electron dynamics (ePES) are constructed from a model of localized electron wave packets (eWP) with non-orthogonal valence-bond (VB) spin coupling and applied to quantum dynamics simulations of high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of hydrogen and helium atoms induced by intense laser pulses. The dynamics of the single electron on the ePES is calculated by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The results reasonably reproduce previous studies. The dynamics of the electron wave function, dipole moment and dipole acceleration were analyzed by comparing one- and two-dimensional calculations. It was found that the main part of the wave function remains within a few Bohrs of the nuclear position, while the part of the wave function that is several orders of magnitude smaller in probability density, which escapes the laser-induced potential barrier by quantum tunneling effect, mainly contributes to the HHG.</summary>

    <title>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</title>

    <summary>The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($γ_Ω$), electrons ($γ_e$), and phonons ($γ_ω$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $γ_Ω$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($μ_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</summary>
