    <summary>Intermolecular vibrations are extremely challenging to describe but are the most crucial part for determining entropy and hence free energies, and enable for instance the distinction between different crystal-packing arrangements of the same molecule via THz spectroscopy. Herein, we introduce a benchmark data set - V30 - containing 30 small molecular dimers with intermolecular interactions ranging from exclusively van-der-Waals dispersion to systems with hydrogen bonds. All calculations are performed with the gold standard of Quantum Chemistry CCSD(T). We discuss vibrational frequencies obtained via different models starting with the harmonic approximation over independent Morse oscillators up to second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which allows a proper anharmonic treatment including coupling of vibrational modes. However, large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency intermolecular modes are problematic for VPT2. In analogy to the often used treatment for internal rotations, we replace such problematic modes by a simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model. We compare selected dimers with available experimental data or high-level calculations of potential energy surfaces and show that VPT2 in combination with hindered rotors can yield a very good description of fundamental frequencies for the discussed subset of dimers involving small and semi-rigid molecules.</summary>

    <title>A study of the magnetocaloric behavior of Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ compounds</title>

    <summary>In this paper, we report on the magnetic and magnetocaloric features of Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ (Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$Mn$_2$O$_5$) with $x=$ 0.6, 0.8, and 1 series elaborated by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements attest well the high quality of our polycrystalline samples that crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pbam space group. The Raman phonon frequencies were carried out and compared with the lattice dynamics calculations to identify the vibrational properties of all detected modes at room temperature. As expected, our magnetic study reveals that the magnetization was enhanced by the substitution of Y$^{3+}$ by Dy$^{3+}$. The Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ sets the Néel transition [TN (Mn)] in the temperature range going from 40 to 45 K favoring the emergence of a transition at a very low temperature due to the long-range ordering of the Dy3+ magnetic moments below 13K [TN (Dy)]. Dual peaks in the magnetic entropy change curve are also observed being in good agreement with magnetization data, which enlarges the range of application of these materials. On the other hand, a large magnetocaloric effect is observed close to 13 K which is mainly due the ordering of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic moments. Also, the incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition of Mn magnetic moment taking place around 40 K affects slightly the entropy change. Our refrigerant capacity (RC) findings are higher compared to the average of RC for a, b, c axis of single crystal samples as HoMn$_2$O$_5$ and TbMn$_2$O$_5$, which confirms that our polycrystalline materials stand for promising magnetic refrigerant candidates that can be invested in space technology, hydrogen and helium liquefaction at cryogenic temperature.</summary>

    <title>Pressure dependence of atomic dynamics in barocaloric ammonium sulfate: I. Rotations</title>

    <summary>Solid-state cooling using barocaloric materials is a promising avenue for eco-friendly, inexpensive and highly efficient cooling. To design barocaloric compounds ready for deployment, it is essential to understand their thermodynamic behaviour under working conditions. To this end, we have studied the rotational dynamics in the molecular-ionic crystal ammonium sulfate under pressure, providing detailed insight into the origin of its large barocaloric effect. Using quasielastic neutron scattering experiments, we show that rotation of the ammonium cations is facilitated by pressure in the low-entropy phase, with the rotational "hopping" motion increasing in frequency as the pressure-induced phase transition is approached. We explain this unusual behaviour in terms of the competing hydrogen-bond networks represented by the two phases. This work includes the first results of a recently developed low-background, high-pressure gas cell for neutron scattering, showcasing its power in obtaining high-precision measurements of molecular dynamics under pressure.</summary>
