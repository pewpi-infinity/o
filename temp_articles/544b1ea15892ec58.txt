    <summary>In this work, we investigate numerically the transport properties of a 2D complex plasma crystal using diffusion of coplanar dust lattice waves. In the limit where the Hamiltonian interactions can be decoupled from the non-Hamiltonian effects, we identify two distinct types of wave transport: Anderson-type delocalization and long-distance excitation. We use a recently-developed spectral approach to evaluate the contribution of the Anderson problem and compare it to the results of the simulation. The benefit of our approach to transport problems is twofold. First, we employ a highly tunable macroscopic hexagonal crystal, which exhibits many-body interactions and allows for the investigation of transport properties at the kinetic level. Second, the analysis of the transport problem in 2D is provided using an innovative spectral approach, which avoids the use of scaling and boundary conditions. Thus, the combination of theoretical calculation with simulation results allows for the study of important characteristics of this open system. The major deviation between the predicted and observed wave dynamics is a long-distance lattice excitation, which occurs even when the initial perturbation does not spread from the center to the exterior of the crystal. In the decoupled Hamiltonian regime, this effect can be contributed to the dust lattice interaction with the plasma environment.</summary>

    <summary>  A comprehensive analytical theory for nonlinear excitations related to horizontal (longitudinal, acoustic mode) as well as vertical (transverse, optical mode) motion of charged dust grains in a dust crystal is presented. Different types of localized excitations, similar to those well known in solid state physics, are reviewed and conditions for their occurrence and characteristics in dusty plasma crystals are discussed. By employing a continuum approximation (i.e. assuming a long variation scale, with respect to the inter-particle distance) a dust crystal is shown to support nonlinear kink-shaped supersonic solitary excitations, associated with longitudinal dust grain displacement, as well as modulated envelope localized modes associated with either longitudinal or transverse oscillations. Although a one-dimensional crystal is considered for simplicity, the results in principle apply to a two-dimensional lattice if certain conditions are satisfied. The effect of mode-coupling is also briefly considered. The relation to previous results on atomic chains, and also to experimental results on strongly-coupled dust layers in gas discharge plasmas, is briefly discussed.</summary>

    <title>Valley-dependent topological edge states in plasma photonic crystals</title>

    <summary>Plasma photonic crystals designed in this paper are composed of gas discharge tubes to control the flow of electromagnetic waves. The band structures calculated by the finite element method are consistent with the experimental results in that two distinct attenuation peaks appear in the ranges of 1 GHz to 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz to 6 GHz. Electromagnetic parameters of the plasma are extracted by the Nicolson-Ross-Weir method and effective medium theory. The measured electron density is between 1e11 cm-3 and 1e12 cm-3, which verifies the correctness of the parameter used in the simulation, and the collision frequency is near 1.5e10 Hz. As the band structures are corroborated by the measured scattering parameters, we introduce the concept of photonic topological insulator based on the quantum Valley Hall effect into the plasma photonic crystal. A valley-dependent plasma photonic crystal with hexagonal lattice is constructed, and the phase transition of the valley K(K') occurs by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Valley-spin locked topological edge states are generated and excited by chiral sources. The frequency of the non-bulk state can be dynamically regulated by the electron density. This concept paves the way for novel, tunable topological edge states. More interestingly, the Dirac cone is broken when the electron density increases to 3.1e12 cm-3, which distinguishes from the methods of applying a magnetic field and changing the symmetry of the point group.</summary>
