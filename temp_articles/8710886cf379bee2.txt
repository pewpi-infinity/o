    <summary>  We study the performances of gaseous and two-phase (liquid-gas) cryogenic detectors of ionizing radiation based on gas electron multipliers (GEMs) and operated in an avalanche mode in pure noble gases. The gas amplification in He, Ar and Kr is systematically studied at low temperatures, using triple-GEM multipliers. High gains, exceeding 10^4, were obtained in these gases in the range of 120-300 K. Stable electron avalanching was demonstrated in a saturated Kr vapor in the two-phase mode. These results are relevant for understanding basic mechanisms of electron avalanching at low temperatures and for applications in cryogenic particle detectors, in particular in dark matter and solar neutrino detectors.</summary>

    <summary>A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$, transfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus. The energy lost by electron is more than the energy gained by the nucleus. The resulting energy goes in exciting the atom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon, mercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber experiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper, we study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering experiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth, why muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like lead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the elastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron microscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these phenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give Bloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give resistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and superconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in Fermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures. Electron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions. We turn our attention to electron-proton scattering both eleastic and inelastic, as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and understand the independence of ineleastic cross-section of with respect to transferred momentum. We see, why we can just say that there are three quarks in proton from elastic cross-section. Our main contribution in this article is we are detailed at places, we find literature terse.</summary>

    <title>Gas Purity effect on GEM Performance in He and Ne at Low Temperatures</title>

    <summary>  The performance of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in gaseous He, Ne, He+H2 and Ne+H2 was studied at temperatures in the range of 3-293 K. This paper reports on previously published measurements and additional studies on the effects of the purity of the gases in which the GEM performance is evaluated. In He, at temperatures between 77 and 293 K, triple-GEM structures operate at rather high gains, exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain is achieved through the Penning effect as a result of impurities in the gas. At lower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics are significantly modified probably due to the freeze-out of these impurities. Double-GEM and single-GEM structures can operate down to 3 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas density of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further. In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in Ne at low temperatures can be re-established in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very high gains, exceeding 104, have been obtained in these mixtures at 30-77 K, at a density of 9.2 g/l which corresponds to saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K. The addition of small amounts of H2 in He also re-establishes large GEM gains above 30 K but no gain was observed in He+H2 at 4 K and a density of 1.7 g/l (corresponding to roughly one-tenth of the saturated vapor density). These studies are, in part, being pursued in the development of two-phase He and Ne detectors for solar neutrino detection.</summary>
