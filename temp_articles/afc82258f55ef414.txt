    <summary>Gravitational waves (GWs) are an exciting new probe of physics beyond the standard models of gravity and particle physics. One interesting possibility is provided by the so-called "gravitational atom," wherein a superradiant instability spontaneously forms a cloud of ultralight bosons around a rotating black hole. The presence of these boson clouds affects the dynamics of black hole binary inspirals and their associated GW signals. In this Letter, we show that the binary companion can induce transitions between bound and unbound states of the cloud, effectively "ionizing" it, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. The orbital energy lost in this process can overwhelm the losses due to GW emission, so that ionization drives the inspiral rather than merely perturbing it. We show that the ionization power contains sharp features that lead to distinctive "kinks" in the evolution of the emitted GW frequency. These discontinuities are a unique signature of the boson cloud and observing them would not only constitute a detection of the ultralight boson itself, but also provide direct information about its mass and the state of the cloud.</summary>

    <summary>Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</summary>

    <summary>Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</summary>
