    <summary>Hydrogen exhibits quantum phenomena, such as tunneling in materials. According to theory, the quantum properties of hydrogen change significantly in superconductors due to the emergence of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which reduces the interaction between hydrogen nucleus (i.e., proton) and conduction electrons. This reduction is predicted to enhance the tunneling probability of protons. Here, we report the double transitions of the electrical resistivity in high-quality palladium hydride (PdHx) and deuteride (PdDx) prepared by low-temperature absorption below T = 180 K. After a sharp drop in the resistivity at T ~ 2 K owing to the superconducting transition of PdH(D)x, a large residual resistivity remained. Additionally, the resistivity dropped to zero below T = 1 K. The experimental results suggest that the quantum tunneling of highly concentrated protons (deuterons) in the superconducting state is responsible for the observed features: the residual resistivity arises from the weakening of the global coherence of superconductivity owing to the tunneling motion of protons (deuterons), while the zero resistivity is caused by long-range ordering of the protons (deuterons). This system offers a new platform for investigating the quantum many-body properties of tunneling particles.</summary>

    <summary>  Quantum relativistic probability description of continuous world is re-examined. The new conception of physical world is offered. It is based on deterministic description of elementary particles, on conception The standard probability quantum relativistic picture of world is reviewed. The new picture of world is proposed. It is based on deterministic approach to elementary particles, discrete model of space determined by segmentation of particles and their fields and also by introduction of 9 Lorentz groups of transformations between systems of reference. It is supposed that elementary particles are segmented in space and change their form dependent on phase and structural state of substance. This approach allow to use linear differential second order equations to describe interactions. Maxwell equations are the partial case of them. This approach allow to eliminate basic paradoxes of quantum field theory and quantum mechanics and gives a new interpretation of well known experiments. To confirm the theory proposed basic parameters of macroquantum effects in condensed medium including cosmic objects are calculated. Particularly, parameters of high temperature superconductors being stable till temperature 93,5 Centdegree are calculated. It is supposed that electrons in atomic hydrogen at 6000 Centdegree at the Sun can occur in superconducting state.</summary>
