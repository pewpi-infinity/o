    <summary>Non-linear optical characteristics of a new BaGa2GeSe6 crystal were numerically studied and compared with well-known mid-IR nonlinear crystals ZnGeP2, GaSe, and AgGaSe2.The calculations demonstrated for the new crystal to be probably the most efficient crystal for second harmonic generation of CO and CO2laser radiation. It was found that a broadband two-stage frequency conversion of multi-line CO-laser radiation in this crystal is possible within 2.5-9.0 μm wavelength range with higher efficiency than in ZnGeP2 and AgGaSe2 crystals.</summary>

    <title>The Near Miss Effect and the Framing of Lotteries</title>

    <summary>We present a framework for analyzing the near miss effect in lotteries. A decision maker (DM) facing a lottery, falsely interprets losing outcomes that are close to winning ones, as a sign that success is within reach. As a result of this false belief, the DM will prefer lotteries that induce a higher frequency of near misses, even if the underlying probability of winning is constant. We define a near miss index that measures the near miss effect induced by a given lottery and analyze the optimal lottery design in terms of near miss. This analysis leads us to establish a fruitful connection between our near miss framework and the field of coding theory. Building on this connection we compare different lottery frames and the near miss effect they induce. Analyzing an interaction between a seller and a buyer of lotteries allows us to gain further insight into the optimal framing of lotteries and might offer a potential explanation as to why lotteries with a very small probability of winning are commonplace and attractive.</summary>

    <title>The relaxation of thermal and high-frequency transverse phonons in the semiconductor cubic crystals</title>

    <summary>  We have considered the relaxation of transverse thermal and high-frequency phonons for the Landau-Rumer mechanism in the semiconductor cubic crystals. Using the known values of these elastic moduli, the parameters determining the transverse phonon relaxation rates for the Landau-Rumer mechanism have been evaluated for the crystals under consideration. It is shown that the dependence of the relaxation rate on the wave vector of thermal and high-frequency phonons strongly differs from the classical Landau-Rumer relationship both in the isotropic medium and in the cubic crystals studied. In contrast to the isotropic medium, for Ge, Si, InSb, and GaSb crystals in the [100] direction, this dependence has an essentially non-monotonic character with two maxima, the second of which is in the range of high-frequency phonons. This anomaly in the [100] direction is most pronounced for InSb and GaSb crystals. The features of the relaxation rate are found to result from the angular dependence of the probability of anharmonic scattering and from the anisotropy of elastic properties.</summary>
