    <summary>Surface modification of different materials exposed to an environment typical for hot cathode ionisation vacuum gauges was investigated. Such environment has been generated in a specially designed setup which simulates conditions in a Bayard-Alpert ionisation vacuum gauge. Characterisations by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and work function study have been performed before and after the sample exposure to Ar and H2 gas discharges. The majority of studied materials, such as molybdenum, gold or stainless steel, are considered to be of interest as ion collectors. In addition, experiments with copper and graphite revealed the major processes that are taking place during the exposure to an ionisation vacuum gauge environment. Since the stability of ionisation vacuum gauges can be affected by the change of secondary electron emission properties of ion collectors during the operation, the corresponding electron yield induced by bombardment of low energy Ar+ ions was measured. Results show that exposure to ionisation vacuum gauge environment contributes to development of hydrocarbon layers, independently from the collector material or the dominant species in the gas discharge. Therefore, ion induced secondary electron yield of clean materials will be changing during the gauge operation and eventually reach saturation regardless of the collector material. The results also show that the hydrocarbon layer cannot be desorbed by standard vacuum baking procedures, whilst ion bombardment will even increase the rate of the hydrocarbon layer formation.</summary>

    <title>Ultrafast Electron Dynamics in the Topological Insulator Bi2Se3 Studied by Time-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

    <summary>We characterize the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ using time- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy. By employing two-photon photoemission, a complete picture of the unoccupied electronic structure from the Fermi level up to the vacuum level is obtained. We demonstrate that the unoccupied states host a second, Dirac surface state which can be resonantly excited by 1.5 eV photons. We then study the ultrafast relaxation processes following optical excitation. We find that they culminate in a persistent non-equilibrium population of the first Dirac surface state, which is maintained by a meta-stable population of the bulk conduction band. Finally, we perform a temperature-dependent study of the electron-phonon scattering processes in the conduction band, and find the unexpected result that their rates decrease with increasing sample temperature. We develop a model of phonon emission and absorption from a population of electrons, and show that this counter-intuitive trend is the natural consequence of fundamental electron-phonon scattering processes. This analysis serves as an important reminder that the decay rates extracted by time-resolved photoemission are not in general equal to single electron scattering rates, but include contributions from filling and emptying processes from a continuum of states.</summary>

    <title>21st Century Planar Field Emission Theory and its Role in Vacuum Breakdown Science</title>

    <summary>For explaining electrical breakdown, field electron emission (FE) is a mechanism of interest. In the period 2006 to 2010 there were significant developments in basic FE theory, but these have not yet fully entered general thinking in technological FE areas, which are often still based on 1960s thinking or (in some contexts) 1920s thinking about FE theory. This paper outlines the history of FE theory and provides an overview of modern developments and of some related topics, in so far as these affect the interpretation of experiments and the explanation of physical phenomena. The paper concentrates on principles, with references given where details can be found. Some suggestions are made about moving to the use of "21st-Century" FE theory. In addition, an error in Feynman's treatment of the electrostatics of pointed conductors is displayed, and it is found that Zener tunneling is implausible as a primary cause of vacuum breakdown from a CuO overlayer.</summary>
