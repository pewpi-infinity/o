    <summary>Materials design has traditionally evolved through trial-error approaches, mainly due to the non-local relationship between microstructures and properties such as strength and toughness. We propose 'alloy informatics' as a machine learning based prototype predictive approach for alloys and compounds, using electron charge density profiles derived from first-principle calculations. We demonstrate this framework in the case of hydrogen interstitials in face-centered cubic crystals, showing that their differential electron charge density profiles capture crystal properties and defect-crystal interaction properties. Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) of defect-induced differential charge density perturbations highlight the resulting screening effect, and, together with hydrogen Bader charges, strongly correlate to a large set of atomic properties of the metal species forming the bulk crystal. We observe the spontaneous emergence of classes of charge responses while coarse-graining over crystal compositions. Nudge-Elastic-Band calculations show that RDFs and charge features also connect to hydrogen migration energy barriers between interstitial sites. Unsupervised machine-learning on RDFs supports classification, unveiling compositional and configurational non-localities in the similarities of the perturbed densities. Electron charge density perturbations may be considered as bias-free descriptors for a large variety of defects.</summary>

    <title>Metallic liquid hydrogen and likely Al2O3 metallic glass</title>

    <summary>Dynamic compression has been used to synthesize liquid metallic hydrogen at 140 GPa (1.4 million bar) and experimental data and theory predict Al2O3 might be a metallic glass at ~300 GPa. The mechanism of metallization in both cases is probably a Mott-like transition. The strength of sapphire causes shock dissipation to be split differently in the strong solid and soft fluid. Once the 4.5-eV H-H and Al-O bonds are broken at sufficiently high pressures in liquid H2 and in sapphire (single-crystal Al2O3), electrons are delocalized, which leads to formation of energy bands in fluid H and probably in amorphous Al2O3. The high strength of sapphire causes shock dissipation to be absorbed primarily in entropy up to ~400 GPa, which also causes the 300-K isotherm and Hugoniot to be virtually coincident in this pressure range. Above ~400 GPa shock dissipation must go primarily into temperature, which is observed experimentally as a rapid increase in shock pressure above ~400 GPa. The metallization of glassy Al2O3, if verified, is expected to be general in strong oxide insulators. Implications for Super Earths are discussed.</summary>

    <title>Reply to Comment on "Does the Equivalence between Gravitational Mass and Energy Survive for a Composite Quantum Body?"</title>

    <summary>We have recently shown that both passive and active gravitational masses of a composite body are not equivalent to its energy due to some quantum effects. We have also suggested an idealized and more realistic experiments to detect the above mentioned inequivalence for a passive gravitational mass. The suggested idealized effect is as follows. A spacecraft moves protons of a macroscopic ensemble of hydrogen atoms with constant velocity in the Earth's gravitational field. Due to non-homogeneous squeezing of space by the field, electron ground state wave function experiences time-dependent perturbation in each hydrogen atom. This perturbation results in the appearance of a finite probability for an electron to be excited at higher energy levels and to emit a photon. The experimental task is to detect such photons from the ensemble of the atoms. More realistic variants of such experiment can be realized in solid crystals and nuclei, as first mentioned by us. In his recent Comment on our paper, Crowell has argued that the effect, suggested by us, contradicts the existing experiments and, in particular, astronomic data. We show here that this conclusion is incorrect and based on the so-called "free fall" experiments, where our effect does not have to be observed.</summary>
