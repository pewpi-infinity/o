    <summary>Hydrogen adsorption on graphene in commensurate periodic arrangements leads to bandgap opening at the Dirac point and the emergence of dispersionless midgap bands. We study these bandgap effects and their dependence on periodicity for a single hydrogen adsorbate on periodic graphene supercells using spin-polarized density-functional theory calculations. Our results show that for certain periodicities, marked by a scale factor of three, the bandgap is suppressed to a great extent, and has a special level structure around the neutrality point. We present explanations for the origin of the changes to the band structure in terms of the \textit{ab initio} Hamiltonian matrix. This method may be used to obtain a more accurate tight-binding description of single hydrogen adsorption on graphene.</summary>

    <summary>Graphene holds great promise for post-silicon electronics, however, it faces two main challenges: opening up a bandgap and finding a suitable substrate material. In principle, graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate provides potential system to overcome these challenges. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have provided conflicting results: while theoretical studies suggested a possibility of a finite bandgap of graphene on hBN, recent experimental studies find no bandgap. Using the first-principles density functional method and the many-body perturbation theory, we have studied graphene on hBN substrate. A Bernal stacked graphene on hBN has a bandgap on the order of 0.1 eV, which disappears when graphene is misaligned with respect to hBN. The latter is the likely scenario in realistic devices. In contrast, if graphene supported on hBN is hydrogenated, the resulting system (graphone) exhibits bandgaps larger than 2.5 eV. While the bandgap opening in graphene/hBN is due to symmetry breaking and is vulnerable to slight perturbation such as misalignment, the graphone bandgap is due to chemical functionalization and is robust in the presence of misalignment. The bandgap of graphone reduces by about 1 eV when it is supported on hBN due to the polarization effects at the graphone/hBN interface. The band offsets at graphone/hBN interface indicate that hBN can be used not only as a substrate but also as a dielectric in the field effect devices employing graphone as a channel material. Our study could open up new way of bandgap engineering in graphene based nanostructures.</summary>

    <title>Single-sided-hydrogenated graphene: Density functional theorypredictions</title>

    <summary>Hydrogenation has proven to be an effective tool to open the bandgap of graphene. In the present density functional study we demonstrate that single-side-hydrogenated graphene is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.89 eV, in between the gapless graphene and wide bandgap graphane. We show that its electronic structure and lattice characteristics are substantially different from those of graphene, graphone, or graphane. The lattice parameter and C-C bond length are found to be lengthened by 15% of those of graphene. Our binding energy analysis confirms that such a single sided hydrogenation leads to thermodynamically stable material.</summary>
