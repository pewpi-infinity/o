    <summary>  We study condensation of closed string tachyons living on defects, such as orbifold fixed planes and Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes. We argue that the high energy density of localized states decreases in the process of condensation of such tachyons. In some cases this means that $c_{eff}$ decreases along the flow; in others, $c_{eff}$ remains constant and the decreasing quantity is a closed string analog, $g_{cl}$, of the ``boundary entropy'' of D-branes. We discuss the non-supersymmetric orbifolds $C/Z_n$ and $C^2/Z_n$. In the first case tachyon condensation decreases $n$ and in some cases connects type II and type 0 vacua. In the second case non-singular orbifolds are related by tachyon condensation to both singular and non-singular ones. We verify that $g_{cl}$ decreases in flows between non-singular orbifolds. The main tools in the analysis are the structure of the chiral ring of the perturbed theory, the geometry of the resolved orbifold singularities, and the throat description of singular conformal field theories.</summary>

    <summary>  This paper deals with a cosmological model in which the universe is filled with tachyon dark energy in order to describe current and future accelerating expansion. We obtain that the simplest condition for the regime of phantom energy to occur in this scenario is that the scalar field be Wick rotated to imaginary values which correspond to an axionic field classically. By introducing analytical expressions for the scale factor or the Hubble parameter that satisfy all constraint equations of the used models we show that such models describe universes which may develop a big rip singularity in the finite future. It is argued that, contrary to a recent claim, the entropy for a universe filled with dark energy is definite positive even on the phantom regime where the universe would instead acquire a negative temperature. It is also seen that, whichever the fate of the tachyonic accelerating universe, it will be stable to any fluctuations of the scalar field, and that since the considered models have all an imaginary sound speed, any overdense regions will undergo an accelerate collapse leading rapidly to formation of giant black holes. Finally the conjecture is advanced that these black holes may be the supermassive black holes that most galaxies harbor at their center.</summary>

    <title>Scalarization of the Reissner-Nordström black hole with higher derivative gauge field corrections</title>

    <summary>We discuss spontaneous scalarization of the Reissner-Nordström black hole in the presence of higher derivative gauge field corrections that arise in the context of string, as well as higher-dimensional more fundamental gravity theories. Our theory admits the Reissner-Nordström solution at the scalar vacuum of the theory ($φ=0$) and we find that the higher order derivative gauge field correction term results in the tachyonic instability of our system once the coupling function satisfies the condition that its second derivative is positive at the scalar vacuum in the appropriate parameter space. We find that the branches do not end with an extremal black hole, rather with a singularity as indicated by the divergence of the Kretschmann scalar. The black holes can be overcharged in the sense that they may carry larger electric charge in comparison to their mass. Finally, these solutions possess larger entropy at the event horizon radius when compared to the Reissner-Nordström black hole, as well as to scalarized black holes without the higher order derivative gauge field terms, indicating in this way the thermodynamic prefer-ability of our system, when compared to existing literature, while they respect the energy conditions.</summary>
