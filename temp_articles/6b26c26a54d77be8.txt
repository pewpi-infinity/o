    <summary>One of the many remarkable properties of graphene is that in the low energy limit the dynamics of its electrons can be effectively described by the massless Dirac equation. This has prompted investigations of graphene based on the lattice simulation of a system of 2-dimensional fermions on a square staggered lattice. We demonstrate here how to construct the path integral for graphene working directly on the graphene hexagonal lattice. For the nearest neighbor tight binding model interacting with a long range Coulomb interaction between the electrons, this leads to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with no sign problem. The only approximation is the discretization of the Euclidean time. So as we extrapolate to the time continuum limit, the exact tight binding solution maybe found numerically to arbitrary precession on a finite hexagonal lattice. The potential for this approach is tested on a single hexagonal cell.</summary>

    <summary>The two-dimensional carbon allotrope graphene has recently attracted a lot of attention from researchers in the disciplines of Lattice Field Theory, Lattice QCD and Monte Carlo calculations. This interest has been prompted by several remarkable properties of the conduction electrons in graphene. For instance, the conical band structure of graphene at low energies is strongly reminiscent of relativistic Dirac fermions. Also, due the low Fermi velocity of v_F = c/300, where c is the speed of light in vacuum, the physics of the conduction electrons in graphene is qualitatively similar to Quantum Electrodynamics in a strongly coupled regime. In turn, this opens up the prospect of the experimental realization of gapped, strongly correlated states in the electronic phase diagram of graphene. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical motivations for Lattice Field Theory studies of graphene, and describe the directions that such research is likely to progress in during the next few years. We also give a brief overview of the two main lattice theories of graphene, the hexagonal Hubbard theory and the low-energy Dirac theory. Finally, we describe the prospect of extracting response functions, such as the electric conductivity, using Lattice Field Theory calculations.</summary>

    <title>Lattice QED in external electromagnetic fields</title>

    <summary>We study QED in external electromagnetic fields using methods developed for simulating lattice QCD. Our first project is to simulate QED in a constant (in space and time) external magnetic field on a euclidean space-time lattice using the Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC) method. Observables we measure include the condensate $\langle\barψψ\rangle$ and the effective electron action after integrating out the fermion fields. We look for evidence that the combined effect of the magnetic field and the electron-positron attraction from QED produces a non-zero condensate in the limit of zero electron mass, a non-perturbative effect analogous to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Very preliminary evidence is that such a condensate exists, at least for strong external magnetic fields and unphysically large electric charge. In addition, we are storing field configurations to measure the expected distortions and screenings of the coulomb field of a charged particle due to the vacuum polarization asymmetries produced by the magnetic field. We hope also to measure the dynamical contribution to the electron mass produced by the same mechanism that produces a finite condensate in the zero input mass limit.</summary>
