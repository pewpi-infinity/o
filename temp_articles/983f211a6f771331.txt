    <summary>  American Sign Language (ASL) uses a series of hand based gestures as a replacement for words to allow the deaf to communicate. Previous work has shown that although it takes longer to make signs than to say the equivalent words, on average sentences can be completed in about the same time. This leaves unresolved, however, precisely why that should be the case. This paper reports a determination of the empirical entropy and redundancy in the set of handshapes of ASL. In this context, the entropy refers to the average information content in a unit of data. It is found that the handshapes, as fundamental units of ASL, are less redundant than phonemes, the equivalent fundamental units of spoken English, and that their entropy is much closer to the maximum possible information content. This explains why the slower signs can produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy compensates for the slow rate of sign production. In addition to this precise quantification, this work is also novel in its approach towards quantifying an aspect of the ASL alphabet. Unlike spoken and written languages, frequency analysis of ASL is difficult due to the fact that every sign is composed of phonemes that are created through a combination of manual and a relatively large and imprecise set of bodily features. Focusing on handshapes as the ubiquitous and universal feature of all sign languages permits a precise quantitative analysis. As interest in visual electronic communication explodes within the deaf community, this work also paves the way for more precise automated sign recognition and synthesis.</summary>

    <summary>Upon melting, the molecules in the crystal explore numerous configurations, reflecting an increase in disorder. The molar entropy of disorder can be defined by Bolzmann's formula dSd = Rln(Wd) where Wd is the increase in the number of microscopic states, so far inaccessible experimentally. We found that the Arrhenius frequency factor A of the electron diffraction signal decay provides Wd via an experimental equation A = AINTWd where AINT is an inelastic scattering cross-section. The method connects Clausius and Boltzmann experimentally and supplements the Clausius approach, being applicable to a femtogram quantity of thermally unstable and biomolecular crystals. The data also showed that crystal disordering and crystallization of melt are reciprocal, both governed by the entropy change, but manifesting in opposite directions.</summary>

    <title>Effects of spatial nonlocality versus nonlocal causality for bound electrons in external fields</title>

    <summary>Using numerically exact solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation together with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) calculations we compare the effects of spatial nonlocality versus nonlocal causality for the ground state and for real-time evolution of two entangled electrons in parabolic potential in one spatial dimension. It was found that the spatial entanglement quantified by the linear quantum entropy is predicted with good accuracy using the spatial nonlocality, parameterized naturally within the TDQMC approach. At the same time, the nonlocal causality predicted by the exact solution leads to only small oscillations in the quantum trajectories which belong to the idler electron as the driven electron is subjected to a strong high frequency electric field, without interaction between the electrons.</summary>
