    <summary>Field-effect transistors made of wide-bandgap semiconductors can operate at high voltages, temperatures and frequencies with low energy losses, and have been of increasing importance in power and high-frequency electronics. However, the poor performance of p-channel transistors compared with that of n-channel transistors has constrained the production of energy-efficient complimentary circuits with integrated n- and p-channel transistors. The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond offers great potential for solving this problem, but surface transfer doping, which is commonly believed to be essential for generating the conductivity, limits the performance of transistors made of hydrogen-terminated diamond because it requires the presence of ionized surface acceptors, which cause hole scattering. Here, we report on fabrication of a p-channel wide-bandgap heterojunction field-effect transistor consisting of a hydrogen-terminated diamond channel and hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) gate insulator, without relying on surface transfer doping. Despite its reduced density of surface acceptors, the transistor has the lowest sheet resistance ($1.4$ k$Ω$) and largest on-current ($1600$ $μ$m mA mm$^{-1}$) among p-channel wide-bandgap transistors, owing to the highest hole mobility (room-temperature Hall mobility: $680$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$). Importantly, the transistor also shows normally-off behavior, with a high on/off ratio exceeding $10^8$. These characteristics are suited for low-loss switching and can be explained on the basis of standard transport and transistor models. This new approach to making diamond transistors paves the way to future wide-bandgap semiconductor electronics.</summary>

    <title>Theoretical Investigation of Charge Transfer Between Two Defects in a Wide-Bandgap Semiconductor</title>

    <summary>Charge traps in the semiconductor bulk (bulk charge traps) make it difficult to predict the electric field within wide-bandgap semiconductors. The issue is the daunting number of bulk charge-trap candidates which means the treatment of bulk charge traps is generally qualitative or uses generalized models that do not consider the trap's particular electronic structure. The electric field within a wide-bandgap semiconductor is nonetheless a crucial quantity in determining the operation of semiconductor devices and the performance of solid-state single-photon emitters embedded within the semiconductor devices. In this work we accurately compute the average electric field measured at the location of N$V^-$ charged defects for the substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) concentration of $n_{\text{N}_\text{C}} \approx 1.41\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the commonly used oxygen-terminated diamond (see [D. A. Broadway $et$ $al$., Nature Electronics 1, 502 (2018)]). We achieve this result by evaluating the leading-order contribution to the electric field far away from the surface, which comes from the N$_\text{C}$ defects that induce the ionization of the N$V^-$. Our results use density-functional theory (DFT) and the principle of band bending. Our work has the potential to aid both in the prediction of the functioning of semiconductor devices and in the prediction and correction of the spectral diffusion that often plagues the optical frequencies of solid-state single-photon emitters upon repeated photoexcitation measurements. Our results for the timescales involved in thermally driven charge transfer also have the potential to aid in investigations of charge dynamics.</summary>

    <title>Direct evidence for efficient carrier multiplication in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>

    <summary>Carrier multiplication (CM), where the absorption of a single photon results in the generation of several electron-hole pairs via impact ionization, plays a pivotal role in the quest for enhancing the performance of solar cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. The combination of its narrow bandgap relative to the photon energy of visible light, along with its low phonon frequencies that hinder efficient energy dissipation into phonons, makes the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ an optimal candidate material for efficient CM. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to trace the number of electron-hole pairs after photoexcitation of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with visible pump pulses at $\hbarω=2$ eV. We find that both the number of electrons inside the conduction band as well as the number of holes inside the valence band keep increasing long after the pump pulse is gone, providing direct evidence for CM. We also analyze the transient band structure as well as the hot carrier dynamics inside the conduction band, providing a complete picture of the non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in photoexcited Bi$_2$Se$_3$ which can now serve as a basis for novel optoelectronic applications.</summary>
