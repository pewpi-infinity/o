    <summary>General formulation in the realm of strong-field quantum electrodynamics is provided for a process that occurs in the presence of a train of laser pulses and, in the tree level, is represented by a two-vertex Feynman diagram with exchange of a virtual photon. A scheme of retrieving resonances in the corresponding probability distributions is also formulated in these general settings. While the presented formalism is applicable to a variety of processes like electron-positron pair creation and annihilation, Möller scattering, Bhabha scattering, etc., we illustrate it for a trident process. Specifically, we consider electron-positron pair creation in the muon--laser-field collisions. We demonstrate that the probability distributions exhibit integrable singularities close to the threshold of pair creation. Also, a variety of resonances is observed that originate from the poles of the Feynman photon propagator. While those resonances are, in general, obscured by strong quantum interferences, we show that they can be isolated by changing the carrier envelope phase of the driving laser pulses. In that case, while transformed into the Lorentz-Breit-Wigner shape profile, the resonance position and width can be determined.</summary>

    <title>Tensor meson transition form factors in holographic QCD and the muon $g-2$</title>

    <summary>Despite the prominence of tensor mesons in photon-photon collisions, until recently their contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been estimated to be at the level of only a few $10^{-12}$. A recent reanalysis within the dispersive approach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in previous approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with opposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the transition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in holographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and the observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant $f_2(1270)$. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark model and in lowest-order resonance chiral theory, the result for $a_μ$ turns out to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few $10^{-11}$. We find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill the gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLbL amplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Matching the corresponding leading-order OPE result leads to two-photon couplings consistent with the observed combined effects of the ground-state $f_2,a_2,f_2'$ multiplet and a total $a_μ^\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution of $+12.4\times 10^{-11}$; with an $F_ρ$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\times 10^{-11}$. A contribution of this size from the tensor sector could explain the tension between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for $a_μ^\mathrm{HLbL}$.</summary>

    <title>An optimized basis for hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>

    <summary>We present a new basis for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) tensor that is optimized for the evaluation of narrow-resonance contributions to HLbL scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. As main advantage, kinematic singularities are manifestly absent for pseudoscalar, scalar, and axial-vector states, while the remaining singularities for tensor resonances are minimized, even avoided for special cases, and simple crossing relations among the scalar functions maintained. We scrutinize the properties of this new basis for the scalar-QED pion box, demonstrating that the partial-wave convergence even slightly improves compared to our previous work, and discuss the physical sum rules that ensure basis independence of the HLbL contribution. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for narrow (pseudo-)scalar, axial-vector, and tensor intermediate states in terms of their respective transition form factors.</summary>
