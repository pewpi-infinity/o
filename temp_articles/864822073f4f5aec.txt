    <summary>Motivated by recent experimental reports of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot systems at the ``sweet spot'', where the electronic hopping $t_h$ is equal to the superconducting coupling $Δ$, we study the time-dependent spectroscopy corresponding to the non-trivial fusion of MZMs. The expression non-trivial refers to the fusion of Majoranas from different original pairs of MZMs, each with well-defined parities. For the first time, we employ an experimentally accessible time-dependent real-space local density-of-states (LDOS) method to investigate the non-trivial MZMs fusion outcomes in canonical chains and in a Y-shape array of interacting electrons. In the case of quantum-dot chains where two pairs of MZMs are initially disconnected, after fusion we find equal-height peaks in the electron and hole components of the LDOS, signaling non-trivial fusion into both the vacuum $I$ and fermion $Ψ$ channels with equal weight. For $π$-junction quantum-dot chains, where the superconducting phase has opposite signs on the left and right portions of the chain, after the non-trivial fusion, we observed the formation of an exotic two-site MZM near the center of the chain, coexisting with another single-site MZM. Furthermore, we also studied the fusion of three MZMs in the Y-shape geometry. In this case, after the fusion we observed the novel formation of another exotic multi-site MZM, with properties depending on the connection and geometry of the central region of the Y-shape quantum-dot array.</summary>

    <summary>The fusion created by magnetically confined plasma is a promising clean and essentially unlimited future energy source. However, net energy generation has not been yet demonstrated in fusion experiments. Some of the main problems hindering controlled fusion are the imperfect magnetic confinement and the associated plasma instabilities. Here, we theoretically demonstrate how to create a fully confined magnetic field with the precise three-dimensional shape required by fusion theory, using a bulk superconducting toroid with a toroidal cavity. The combination of the properties of superconductors with the toroidal topology makes the vacuum field in the cavity volume consisting of nested flux surfaces, a condition for optimum plasma confinement. The coils creating the field, embedded in the superconducting bulk, can be chosen with very simple shapes, in contrast with the cumbersome arrangements in current experiments, and can be spared from the large magnetic forces between them. Because the field shape in the cavity is given by the boundary conditions in the superconductor surface, the system will always tend to maintain the optimum field distribution in response to instabilities or turbulence in the plasma. This field shape is preserved even when holes are drilled in the superconductor to access the plasma region from the exterior. We demonstrate how a fully-confined magnetic field with the three-dimensional spatial distribution required in two of the most advanced stellarators, Large Helical Device and Wendelstein 7-X, can be exactly generated, using simple round coils as magnetic sources. We argue that state-of-the-art high-temperature superconductors already have the necessary properties to be employed to construct the bulk superconducting toroid. The present strategy can lead to optimized robust magnetic confinement and largely simplified configurations in future fusion experiments.</summary>

    <title>ARC: A compact, high-field, fusion nuclear science facility and demonstration power plant with demountable magnets</title>

    <summary>The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor conceptual design study aims to reduce the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a 200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio &gt;= 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a high-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.</summary>
