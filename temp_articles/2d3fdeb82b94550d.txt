    <summary>High-entropy oxides (HEOs), containing at least five principal cations, have recently emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Despite their high potential, the impact of the cation mixtures on photocatalytic activity remains poorly understood. This study investigates the high-entropy photocatalyst TiZrHfNbTaO11 using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods to elucidate the effects of various elements on electronic structure and water splitting performance. The results indicate that the HEO exhibits a bandgap comparable to TiO2 polymorphs rutile, brookite and anatase. Cations with lower electronegativity, such as hafnium and zirconium, provide the strongest water adsorption energy, serving as active sites for water adsorption. Additionally, the co-presence of highly electronegative cations like niobium and tantalum adjacent to hafnium and zirconium enhances charge transfer to water molecules, improving splitting efficiency. These findings suggest novel strategies for designing high-entropy photocatalysts by synergistic incorporating cations with different electronegativities.</summary>

    <title>Photoreforming of plastic waste into valuable products and hydrogen using a high-entropy oxynitride with distorted atomic-scale structure</title>

    <summary>The persistent existence of plastic waste causes serious problems for the environment, directly and indirectly affecting the health of organisms and humans. Photoreforming is a nature-friendly method that only uses solar energy to convert plastic waste into green hydrogen (H2) and valuable organic products. This study shows that a high-entropy oxynitride (HEON) photocatalyst, synthesized by the addition of nitrogen to a Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-containing high-entropy oxide (HEO), exhibits a higher potential for the production of H2, formic acid and acetic acid from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) photoreforming compared to the relevant HEO. Examination of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) by synchrotron light shows that, in addition to hybridization of 2p orbitals from oxygen and nitrogen, nitrogen atoms distort the structure and completely change the neighborhood of niobium and titanium (a main contributor to the conduction band), expands the atomic bonds of zirconium and tantalum, contracts the atomic bonds of hafnium and decreases the binding energy of titanium, niobium and tantalum. These electronic structure changes lead to a narrower bandgap and diminished electron-hole recombination, enhancing the photoreforming performance. This study introduces HEONs with distorted atomic bond structures as efficient low-bandgap and stable catalysts for transforming plastics into high-value organic chemicals and H2 by photocatalysis.</summary>

    <title>Mixed atomic-scale electronic configuration as a strategy to avoid cocatalyst utilization in photocatalysis by high-entropy oxides</title>

    <summary>To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.</summary>
