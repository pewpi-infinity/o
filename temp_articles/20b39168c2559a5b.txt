    <summary>  Graphene is at the forefront of condensed matter sciences, because of a variety of interesting phenomena it supports. If graphene could support high Tc superconductivity, after doping for example, it will make it even more valuable. Some authors have suggested possibility of superconductivity in graphite like systems. However, an early suggestion of one of us (Baskaran) was unique in the sense it combined Pauling's classic idea of resonating valence bond physics with band theory to obtain some exciting results for superconductivity. Black-Schaffer and Doniach took this approach further and found an unconventional d + id order parameter. To sharpen our theory and get more convincing and reliable results for superconductivity, we introduce a correlated variational BCS ground state wavefunction and perform extensive Monte Carlo study of the repulsive Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find that undoped graphene is not a superconductor, consistent with experiments and also mean field results. Interestingly, an appreciable superconducting order is obtained around an optimal doping. This result and a supportive slave particle analysis together suggest the possibility of high temperature superconductivity in doped graphene.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity from dual-surface carriers in rhombohedral graphene</title>

    <summary>Intrinsic rhombohedral graphene hosts an unusual low-energy electronic wavefunction, predominantly localized at its outer crystal faces with negligible presence in the bulk. Increasing the number of graphene layers amplifies the density of states near charge neutrality, greatly enhancing the susceptibility to symmetry-breaking phases. Here, we report superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene arising from an unusual charge-delocalized semimetallic normal state, characterized by coexisting valence- and conduction-band Fermi pockets split to opposite crystal surfaces. In octalayer graphene, the superconductivity appears in five apparently distinct pockets for each sign of an external electric displacement field ($D$). In a moiré superlattice sample where heptalayer graphene is aligned on one side to hexagonal boron nitride, two pockets of superconductivity emerge from a single sharp resistive feature. At higher $D$ the same resistive feature additionally induces an $h/e^{2}$-quantized anomalous Hall state at dopings near one electron per moiré unit cell. Our findings reveal a novel superconducting regime in multilayer graphene and create opportunities for coupling to nearby topological states.</summary>

    <title>Tunable superconductivity in electron- and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

    <summary>Graphene-based, high quality two-dimensional electronic systems have emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying superconductivity. Specifically, superconductivity has been observed in both electron-doped and hole-doped twisted graphene moire systems, whereas in crystalline graphene systems, superconductivity has so far only been observed in hole-doped rhombohedral trilayer and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG). Recently, enhanced superconductivity has been demonstrated in BBG due to the proximity with a monolayer WSe2. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity and a series of flavor-symmetry-breaking phases in both electron- and hole-doped BBG/WSe2 device by electrostatic doping. The strength of the observed superconductivity is tunable by applied vertical electric fields. The maximum Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature for the electron- and hole-doped superconductivity is about 210 mK and 400 mK, respectively. Superconductivities emerge only when applied electric fields drive BBG electron or hole wavefunctions toward the WSe2 layer, underscoring the importance of the WSe2 layer in the observed superconductivity. We find the hole-doped superconductivity violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, consistent with an Ising-like superconductor. In contrast, the electron-doped superconductivity obeys the Pauli limit, even though the proximity induced Ising spin-orbit coupling is also notable in the conduction band. Our findings highlight the rich physics associated with the conduction band in BBG, paving the way for further studies into the superconducting mechanisms of crystalline graphene and the development of novel superconductor devices based on BBG.</summary>
