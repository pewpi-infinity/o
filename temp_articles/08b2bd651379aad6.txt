    <summary>Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves observed in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless, unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot suprathermal electrons (modeled by a $κ$-type distribution), and stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam velocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to obtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $κ$) of the hot electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the electron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool electron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $κ$). It is found that the electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary waves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio.</summary>

    <summary>  We analyze the obtained solutions of the non-linear Shroedinger equation for spherically and axially symmetrical electrons density oscillations in plasma. The conditions of the oscillations process existence are examined. It is shown that in the center or on the axis of symmetry of the systems the static density of electrons enhances. This process results in the increasing of density and pressure of the ion gas. We suggest that this mechanism could occur in nature as rare phenomenon called the fireball and could be used in carrying out the research concerning controlled fusion. The description of the experiments, carried out for the purpose to generate long-lived spherical plasma structures, is presented.</summary>

    <title>Drift instabilities driven by slab ion temperature gradient in suprathermal plasmas</title>

    <summary>The drift instabilities driven by the slab ion temperature gradient (ITG) in Kappa-distributed plasmas are investigated by the kinetic method. The linear dispersion relation is given in an integral representation involving only the standard plasma dispersion function. The wave frequency and growth rate are derived without the density inhomogeneity. Numerical solutions of the dispersion equation are conducted to show the different effects of the suprathermal ions and electrons. We find that the suprathermal ions can enhance the instability in large wavenumbers but suppress it in small wavenumbers. Thus, the suprathermalization of ions could be one of the factors leading to a lower limit of wavenumbers for the ITG instabilities. Besides, the numerical calculations also imply that the thermal speed ratio affects the intensities of the suprathermal effects. Finally, in the presence of density inhomogeneity, the ITG instability boundary is numerically analyzed.</summary>
