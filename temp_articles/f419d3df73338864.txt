    <summary>Point-contact (PC) investigations on the title compound in the normal and superconducting (SC) state (Tc=10,6 K) are presented. The temperature dependence of the SC gap of TmNi2B2C determined from Andreev-reflection (AR) spectra using the standard single-gap approximation (SGA) deviates from the BCS behavior in displaying a maximum at about Tc/2. A refined analysis within the two-gap approximation provides evidence for the presence of a second gap twice as large as the main gap (the first one), while the latter is close to that within the SGA. This way, TmNi2B2C expands the number of nickel borocarbide superconductors which exhibit a clear multiband character. Additionally, for the first time "reentrant" features were found in the AR spectra for some PCs measured in a magnetic field. The PC spectroscopy of the electron-boson interaction in TmNi2B2C in the normal state reveals a pronounced phonon maximum at 9.5meV and a more smeared one around 15 meV, while at higher energies the PC spectra are almost featureless. Additionally, the most intense peak slightly above 3meV observed in the PC spectra of TmNi2B2C is presumably caused by crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations. The peak near 1meV detected for some PC spectra is connected with a modification of the CEF probably due to boron or carbon vacancies, allowing to probe the local stoichiometry by PC spectroscopy.</summary>

    <title>Two energy scales and close relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity in underdoped cuprate superconductors</title>

    <summary>  By measuring the low temperature specific heat, the low energy quasi-particle excitation has been derived and analyzed in systematically doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ single crystals. The Volovik's relation predicted for a d-wave superconductor has been well demonstrated in wide doping regime, showing a robust evidence for the d-wave pairing symmetry. Furthermore the nodal gap slope $v_Δ$ of the superconducting gap is derived and is found to follow the same doping dependence of the pseudogap obtained from ARPES and tunnelling measurement. This strongly suggests a close relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity. Taking the entropy conservation into account, we argue that the ground state of the pseudogap phase should have Fermi arcs with finite density of states at zero K, and the transport data show that it behaves like an insulator due to probably weak localization. A nodal metal picture for the pseudogap phase cannot interpret the data. Based on the Fermi arc picture for the pseudogap phase it is found that the superconducting energy scale or $T_c$ in underdoped regime is governed by both the maximum gap and the spectral weight from the Fermi arcs. This suggests that there are two energy scales: superconducting energy scale and the pseudogap. The superconductivity may be formed by the condensation of Fermi arc quasiparticles through pairing by exchanging virtue bosons.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity and Disorder in High-Tc Materials: Crystalline Copper Oxides and Liquid Metallic Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>  Our goals are to assist a non-practitioner understand likely resolution of the controversy about the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Cu oxides and to consider if high temperature superconductivity (HTS) in solid oxides might be related to predicted HTS in liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) near 0 K. High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS. There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.</summary>
