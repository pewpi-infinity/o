    <summary>In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</summary>

    <title>The quantum nature of the superconducting hydrogen sulfide at finite temperatures</title>

    <summary>H$_3$S is believed to the most possible high-temperature superconducting ($T_{\text{c}}$) phase of hydrogen sulfide at $\sim$200 GPa. It's isotope substitution of hydrogen (H) by deuterium (D), however, shows an anomalous $T_{\text{c}}$ decrease of $\sim$100 K at 140 to 160 GPa, much larger than the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory prediction. Using ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), we show that the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) influence the structures of H$_3$S and D$_3$S differently at finite temperatures and the interval when H$_3$S possesses the symmetric high $T_{\text{c}}$ structure while D$_3$S does not is in agreement with, though their absolute values are lower than experiments. This is consistent with an earlier theoretical study using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation method in descriptions of the nuclei at 0 K.The remaining discrepancy can be substantially improved when the electronic structures are calculated using a hybrid function. Our study presents a simple picture to interpret the isotope dependent of $T_{\text{c}}$ and emphasizes the quantum nature in the high-pressure hydrogen sulfide system.</summary>

    <title>Enhancing superconducting transition temperature of lanthanum superhydride by increasing hydrogen vacancy concentration</title>

    <summary>Various clathrate superhydride superconductors have been found to possess hydrogen deficiency in experimental samples, while their impacts on superconductivity are often neglected. In this study, we investigate the superconductivity of lanthanum superhydride with hydrogen deficiency (LaH$_{10-δ}$) from first principles using path-integral approaches. Under the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations, hydrogen vacancies are found to diffuse within the system, leading to modifications in ion vibrations, electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling. These changes result in a non-monotonic dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) on the vacancy concentration ($δ$). By comparing the experimental and theoretical equations of state, we suggest that $δ$ varies across samples under different pressures. This explains the positive pressure dependence of $T_c$ in experiments below 150 GPa. Remarkably, within this pressure range, we find that $T_c$ could be further raised by increasing $δ$.</summary>
