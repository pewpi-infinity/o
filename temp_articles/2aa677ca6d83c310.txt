    <summary>A new conjecture is proposed that there are two sorts of matter called s-matter and v-matter which are symmetric and whose gravitational masses are opposite to each other, although both masses are positive. Therefore, there are two sorts of symmetry breaking called V-breaking and S-breaking. In the S-breaking, s-particles get their masses and form s-galaxies etc., while v-fermions and v-gauge bosons are still massless and form v-SU(5) singlets. There is no interaction among the v-SU(5) color-single states except gravitation so that they distribute loosely in space, cannot be observed and cause space to expand with an acceleration. When temperature increases to the critical temperature because space contracts, masses of all particles are zero so that s-particles and v-particles transform from one to another and the gravitational mass density becomes negative. Consequently, space stop to contract and inflation must occur. After reheating, space first expands with a deceleration and then expands with an acceleration up to now. There is no space-time singularity. There are the critical temperature, the highest temperature and the least scale in the universe. A formula describing distance-redshift is obtained. A huge void is not empty, and is equivalent to a huge concave lens. The densities of hydrogen in the huge voids must be much less than that predicted by the conventional theory. The gravitation between two galaxies with distance long enough will be less than that predicted by the conventional theory. A black hole with its mass and density big enough will transform into a white hole. Primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB are explained. It is possible that the universe is composed of infinite cosmic islands. The problem of energy conservation is discussed.</summary>

    <summary>A continuum model for low-energy physisorption on a membrane under tension is proposed and studied with variational mean-field theory. A discontinuous change in the energy-dependent sticking coefficient is predicted under certain conditions. This singularity is a result of the bosonic orthogonality catastrophe of the vibrational states of the membrane. The energy-dependent sticking coefficient is predicted to have exponential scaling in 1/E above the singularity. The application of this model to the quantum sticking of cold hydrogen to suspended graphene is discussed. The model predicts that a beam of atomic hydrogen can be completely reflected by suspended graphene at ultralow energies.</summary>

    <title>Infrared Dynamics of Cold Atoms on Hot Graphene Membranes</title>

    <summary>We study the infrared dynamics of low-energy atoms interacting with a sample of suspended graphene at finite temperature. The dynamics exhibits severe infrared divergences order by order in perturbation theory as a result of the singular nature of low-energy flexural phonon emission. Our model can be viewed as a two-channel generalization of the independent boson model with asymmetric atom-phonon coupling. This allows us to take advantage of the exact non-perturbative solution of the independent boson model in the stronger channel while treating the weaker one perturbatively. In the low-energy limit, the exact solution can be viewed as a resummation (exponentiation) of the most divergent diagrams in the perturbative expansion. As a result of this procedure, we obtain the atom's Green function which we use to calculate the atom damping rate, a quantity equal to the quantum sticking rate. A characteristic feature of our results is that the Green's function retains a weak, infrared cutoff dependence that reflects the reduced dimensionality of the problem. As a consequence, we predict a measurable dependence of the sticking rate on graphene sample size. We provide detailed predictions for the sticking rate of atomic hydrogen as a function of temperature and sample size. The resummation yields an enhanced sticking rate relative to the conventional Fermi golden rule result (equivalent to the one-loop atom self-energy), as higher-order processes increase damping at finite temperature.</summary>
