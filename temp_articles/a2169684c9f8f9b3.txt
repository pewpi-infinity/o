    <summary>Entropic contributions to the stability of solids are very well understood and the mixing entropy has been used for forming various solids, for instance such as inverse spinels. A particular development was related to high entropy alloys in which the configurational disorder is responsible for forming simple solid solutions and which are thoroughly studied for various applications especially due to their mechanical properties but also electrical properties, hydrogen storage, magnetic properties. Many unexplored compositions and properties still remain for this class of materials due to their large phase space. In a recent report it has been shown that the configurational disorder can be used for stabilizing simple solid solutions of oxides, which should normally not form solid solutions, these new materials were called "entropy-stabilized oxides". In this pioneering report, it was shown that mixing five equimolar binary oxides yielded, after heating at high temperature and quenching, an unexpected rock salt structure compound with statistical distribution of the cations in a face centered cubic lattice. Following this seminal study, we show here that these high entropy oxides (named HEOx hereafter) can be substituted by aliovalent elements with a charge compensation mechanism. This possibility largely increases the potential development of new materials by widening their (already complex) phase space. As a first example, we report here that at least one HEOx composition exhibits colossal dielectric constants, which could make it very promising for applications as large-k dielectric materials.</summary>

    <title>Efficient photoreforming of plastic waste using a high-entropy oxide catalyst</title>

    <summary>Simultaneous catalytic hydrogen (H2) production and plastic waste degradation under light, known as photoreforming, is a novel approach to green fuel production and efficient waste management. Here, we use a high-entropy oxide (HEO), a new family of catalysts with five or more principal cations in their structure, for plastic degradation and simultaneous H2 production. The HEO shows higher activity than that of P25 TiO2, a benchmark photocatalyst, for the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in water. Several valuable products are produced by photoreforming of PET bottles and microplastics including H2, terephthalate, ethylene glycol and formic acid. The high activity is attributed to the diverse existence of several cations in the HEO lattice, lattice defects, and appropriate charge carrier lifetime. These findings suggest that HEOs possess high potential as new catalysts for concurrent plastic waste conversion and clean H2 production.</summary>
