    <summary>Hydrogenation has proven to be an effective tool to open the bandgap of graphene. In the present density functional study we demonstrate that single-side-hydrogenated graphene is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.89 eV, in between the gapless graphene and wide bandgap graphane. We show that its electronic structure and lattice characteristics are substantially different from those of graphene, graphone, or graphane. The lattice parameter and C-C bond length are found to be lengthened by 15% of those of graphene. Our binding energy analysis confirms that such a single sided hydrogenation leads to thermodynamically stable material.</summary>

    <title>Large Transport Gap Modulation in Graphene via Electric Field Controlled Reversible Hydrogenation</title>

    <summary>Graphene is of interest in the development of next-generation electronics due to its high electron mobility, flexibility and stability. However, graphene transistors have poor on/off current ratios because of the absence of a bandgap. One approach to introduce an energy gap is to use hydrogenation reaction, which changes graphene into insulating graphane with sp3 bonding. Here we show that an electric field can be used to control conductor-to-insulator transitions in microscale graphene via a reversible electrochemical hydrogenation in an organic liquid electrolyte containing dissociative hydrogen ions. The fully hydrogenated graphene exhibits a lower limit sheet resistance of 200 Gohm/sq, resulting in graphene field-effect transistors with on/off current ratios of 10^8 at room temperature. The devices also exhibit high endurance, with up to one million switching cycles. Similar insulating behaviours are also observed in bilayer graphene, while trilayer graphene remains highly conductive after the hydrogenation. Changes in the graphene lattice, and the transformation from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, is confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by first-principles calculations.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogenation of Penta-Graphene Leads to Unexpected Large Improvement in Thermal Conductivity</title>
    <updated>2016-04-13T03:52:58Z</updated>

    <summary>Penta-graphene (PG) has been identified as a novel 2D material with an intrinsic bandgap, which makes it especially promising for electronics applications. In this work, we use first-principles lattice dynamics and iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to determine the thermal conductivity of PG and its more stable derivative - hydrogenated penta-graphene (HPG). As a comparison, we also studied the effect of hydrogenation on graphene thermal conductivity. In contrast to hydrogenation of graphene, which leads to a dramatic decrease in thermal conductivity (from 3590 to 1328 W/mK - a 63% reduction), HPG shows a notable increase in thermal conductivity (615 W/mK), which is 76% higher than that of PG (350 W/mK). The high thermal conductivity of HPG makes it more thermally conductive than most other semi-conducting 2D materials, such as the transition metal chalcogenides. Our detailed analyses show that the primary reason for the counter-intuitive hydrogenation-induced thermal conductivity enhancement is the weaker bond anharmonicity in HPG than PG. This leads to weaker phonon scattering after hydrogenation, despite the increase in the phonon scattering phase space. The high thermal conductivity of HPG may inspire intensive research around HPG and other derivatives of PG as potential materials for future nanoelectronic devices. The fundamental physics understood from this study may open up a new strategy to engineer thermal transport properties of other 2D materials by controlling bond anharmonicity via functionalization.</summary>
