    <summary>In this work we propose a new approach to the explanation of the nature of electron based on the corpuscular-wave monism using the further development of the optical-mechanical analogy to describe the physical reality. In this theory the motion of an electron is considered to occur along a trajectory the presence of which is a reflection of the existence of a particle, as well as it is assumed that any motion is defined by a wave V(x,t). It is assumed that there is an explicit relationship between the trajectory and wave equations of the electron, which are established on the basis of the local variational principle. In this approach, an electron wave propagating in free space takes along the electron trajectory. We used this theory to describe the electron motion in a hydrogen-like atom and found its stationary states. The energies of these states coincide with the known quantum mechanics solutions for the stationary energies of the hydrogen-like atom, however, in our approach the spatial trajectories of the electron have the form of the surfaces, which are formed in the region of nodes of the standing electron wave. These surfaces have the form of spheres for the spherical symmetrical electron states and the radii of these spheres coincide with the radii of the Bohr orbits of these states. Thus, in this approach the trajectory and wave measurements of the electron get a consistent spatial description that is inherent to the picture of the corpuscular-wave monism. We discuss the considerable correspondence of the proposed theory with the quantum mechanics results describing the stationary and non-stationary motions of the electron in the atom and their difference. We believe that measuring of the spatial configuration of the observed electron trajectory surfaces in an atom could be a deep examination of the standard quantum theory.</summary>

    <summary>The hydrogen sorption performance of V55Ti21Cr17Fe7 and V55Ti21Mn17Fe7 alloys and their ribbons were evaluated by pressure composition temperature tests. Their hydrogen absorption kinetic properties were studied through hydrogen absorption curves. The crystallographic structures and microstructure of these alloys and ribbons before hydrogen absorption and after hydrogen desorption PCT tests were identified by Xray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy analysis, respectively. Hydrogen storage characteristics of such materials were investigated by volumetric method using Sieverts type apparatus and gravimetric method with suspension balance.</summary>

    <title>The Spectral Decomposition of the Helium atom two-electron configuration in terms of Hydrogenic orbitals</title>

    <summary>The two electron configuration in the Helium atom is known to very high precision. Yet, we tend to refer to this configuration as a $1s\uparrow 1s\downarrow$ singlet, where the designations refer to Hydrogen orbitals. The high precision calculations utilize basis sets that are suited for high accuracy and ease of calculation, but do not really aid in our understanding of the electron configuration in terms of product states of Hydrogen orbitals. Since undergraduate students are generally taught to think of Helium, and indeed, the rest of the periodic table, in terms of Hydrogenic orbitals, we present in this paper a detailed spectral decomposition of the two electron ground state for Helium in terms of these basis states. The $1s\uparrow 1s\downarrow$ singlet contributes less than 93% to the ground state configuration, with other contributions coming from both bound and continuum Hydrogenic states.</summary>
