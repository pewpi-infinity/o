    <summary>We show that oxidation of phosphorene can lead to the formation of a new family of planar (2D) and tubular (1D) oxides and sub-oxides, most of them insulating. This confers to black phosphorus a native oxide that can be used as barrier material and protective layer. Further, the bandgap of phosphorene oxides depends on the oxygen concentration, suggesting that controlled oxidation can be used as a means to engineer the bandgap. For the oxygen saturated composition, P$_2$O$_5$, both the planar and tubular phases have a large bandgap energy of about 8.5eV, and are transparent in the near UV. These two forms of phosphorene oxides are predicted to have the same formation enthalpy as o$^\prime$-P$_2$O$_5$, the most stable of the previously known forms of phosphorus pentoxide.</summary>

    <title>Moderate bandgap and high carrier mobility simultaneously realized in bilayer silicene by oxidation</title>

    <summary>Semiconductors simultaneously possessing high carrier mobility, moderate bandgap, and ambient environment stability are so important for the modern industry, and Si-based semiconducting materials can match well with the previous silicon based electronic components. Thus, searching for such Si-based semiconductors has been one hot project due to the lack of them nowadays. Here, with the help of density functional theory, we found that the oxidized bilayer silicene exhibits high carrier mobility with a moderate direct bandgap of 1.02 eV. The high carrier mobility is caused by the remaining of big pi bond, and the moderate bandgap is opened by the saturation of dangling Si 3p bonds. Originated from the formation of strong Si-O and Si-Si bonds, the sample exhibits strong thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities. Our work indicates that the oxidized bilayer silicene has many potential applications in modern electronic fields.</summary>

    <title>Controlled Preparation, Characterization, and Bandgap Modulation of RF Sputtered Antimony Vanadium Oxide (SbVO4) Thin Films</title>

    <summary>In this paper, RF sputtered antimony vanadium oxide (SbVO4) thin films and its characterization are reported. High purity sputtering targets were fabricated by sintering a mixture of Sb2O3 and V2O5 powders. Thin films were deposited by reactive sputtering at various temperature and argon/oxygen partial pressures. Several growth parameters and surface chemistry were studied by applying numerous optical and electrochemical characterization technique. It is found that SbVO4 exhibits an indirect band gap in the range of 1.89 eV to 2.36 eV and has desirable valence band position to drive water oxidation reaction under illumination. The bandgap depends heavily on stoichiometry of the film and can be modulated by incorporating controlled amount of oxygen gas in plasma environment. Optimized SbVO4 photoanodes was designed and tested for photoelectrochemical water oxidation catalysis. Preliminary studies show that these electrodes possess n-type catalytic behavior in alkaline media. The prepared SbVO4 thin films, with typical film thickness was around 400 nm, contain nanoparticles having the sizes of 10-15 nm.</summary>
