    <summary>Graphene nanoribbons' electronic transport properties strongly depend on the type of edge, armchair, zigzag or other, and on edge functionalization that can be used for band-gap engineering. For only partly hydrogenated edges interesting magnetic properties are predicted. Electric charge accumulates at edges and corners. Scanning force microscopy has so far shown the centre of graphene nanoribbons with atomic resolution using a quartz crystal tuning fork sensor of high stiffness. Weak long-range electrostatic forces related to the charge accumulation on the edges of graphene nanoribbons could not be imaged so far. Here, we show the electrostatic forces at the corners and edges of graphene nanoribbons are amenable to measurement. We use soft cantilevers and a bimodal imaging technique to combine enhanced sensitivity to weak long-range electrostatic forces with the high resolution of the second-frequency shift. Additionally, in our work the edges of the nanoribbons are mainly hydrogen-free, opening to the route to investigations of partly hydrogenated magnetic nanoribbons.</summary>

    <title>Acoustoelectric transport at gigahertz frequencies in coated epitaxial graphene</title>

    <summary>Epitaxial graphene (EG) produced from SiC surfaces by silicon sublimation is emerging as a material for electronic applications due to its good electronic properties and availability over large areas on a semiconducting substrate. In this contribution, we report on the transport of charge carriers in EG on SiC using high-frequency ($&gt;$ 1 GHz) surface acoustic waves (SAWs). In our devices, the EG is coated with hydrogen-silsesquioxane, SiO$_2$ and a ZnO layer. This allows the efficient generation of SAWs and is compatible with the deposition of a metal top gate. Measurements of frequency- and time-resolved power scattering parameters confirm the generation and propagation of SAWs with frequencies of up to more than 7 GHz. Furthermore, the ZnO coating enhances the acoustoelectric currents by two orders of magnitude as compared to our previous uncoated samples. These results are an important step towards the dynamic acoustic control of charge carriers in graphene at gigahertz frequencies.</summary>

    <summary>Here we present an overview of recent fundamental studies on the nature of the interaction between individual metal atoms and metal clusters and the conjugated surfaces of graphene and carbon nanotube with a particular focus on the electronic structure and chemical bonding at the metal-graphene interface. We discuss the relevance of organometallic complexes of graphitic materials to the development of a fundamental understanding of these interactions and their application in atomtronics as atomic interconnects, high mobility organometallic transistor devices, high-frequency electronic devices, organometallic catalysis (hydrogen fuel generation by photocatalytic water splitting, fuel cells, hydrogenation), spintronics, memory devices and in the next generation energy devices. We touch on CVD graphene grown on metals, the reactivity of its surface, and its use as a template for asymmetric graphene functionalization chemistry (ultrathin Janus discs). We highlight some of the latest advances in understanding the nature of interactions between metals and graphene surfaces from the standpoint of metal overlayers deposited on graphene and SWNT thin films. Finally, we comment on the major challenges facing the field and the opportunities for technological applications.</summary>
