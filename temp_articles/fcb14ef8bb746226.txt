    <summary>  In this report, we describe characteristics of a ring-structure hydrogen plasma heated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions and confined in a mirror magnetic trap and discuss the relative efficiency of secondary electrons and thermoelectrons in negative hydrogen and deuterium ion production. The obtained data and calculations of the balance equations for possible reactions demonstrate that the negative ion production is realized in two stages. First, the hydrogen and deuterium molecules are excited in collisions with the plasma electrons to high-laying Rydberg or vibrational levels in the plasma volume. The second stage leads to the negative ion production through the process of dissociative attachment of low energy electrons. The low energy electrons are originated due to a bombardment of the plasma electrode by ions of one of the driven rings and thermoemission from heated tungsten filaments. Experiments seem to indicate that the negative ion generation occurs predominantly in the limited volume filled with thermoelectrons. Estimation of the negative ion generation rate shows that the main channel of and ion production involves the process of high Rydberg state excitation.</summary>

    <summary>A low pressure discharge sustained in molecular hydrogen with help of the electron cyclotron resonance heating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is simulated using a fully electromagnetic implicit charge- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo code. The simulations show a number of kinetic effects, and the results are in good agreement with various experimentally measured data such as electron density, electron temperature and degree of dissociation. The electron energy distribution shows a tri-Maxwellian form due to a number of different electron heating mechanisms, agreeing with the experimental data in the measured electron energy interval. The simulation results are also verified against a drift-diffusion model and proximity is observed between the computational results for the plasma density at the location of experimental measurement. However, the fluid approximation fails to accurately predict radical density and electron temperature because of the assumption of a single electron temperature. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of hydrogen radicals, whose production is strongly underestimated by the fluid model, whereas it is well predicted by the model considered here. The energy distribution of such radicals demonstrates the presence of a relatively large number of energetic hydrogen atoms produced by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The new insights are of significance for practical applications of hydrogen plasmas.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma characterization based on simple optical emission spectroscopy</title>

    <summary>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma measurements based on simple optical emission spectroscopy on a new compact low current ion source designed and built by the authors is presented. By observing the plasma luminescence both directly and through a low-cost transmission diffraction grating, basic characterization of the Hydrogen plasma obtainable in the ion source is carried out. Through simple processing of CCD captures of these images, optimal values for the ion source relevant operation parameters, including RF power and frequency, and Hydrogen mass flow are easily obtained. Despite the simplicity of the method and its limited accuracy as compared to the use of a full standard optical spectrometric set-up, it is shown that the presented approach can cope with basic plasma diagnostic tasks as far as the successful operation of the ion source is concerned.</summary>
