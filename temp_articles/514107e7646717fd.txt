    <summary>We present a systematic investigation of the effect of H, B, C, and N interstitials on the electronic, lattice and magnetic properties of La(Fe,Si)$_{13}$ using density functional theory. The parent LaSiFe$_{12}$ alloy has a shallow, double-well free energy function that is the basis of itinerant metamagnetism. On increasing the dopant concentration, the resulting lattice expansion causes an initial increase in magnetisation for all interstitials that is only maintained at higher levels of doping in the case of hydrogen. Strong s-p band hybridisation occurs at high B,C and N concentrations. We thus find that the electronic effects of hydrogen doping are much less pronounced than those of other interstitials, and result in the double-well structure of the free energy function being least sensitive to the amount of hydrogen. This microscopic picture accounts for the vanishing first order nature of the transition by B,C, and N dopants as observed experimentally. We use our calculated electronic density of states for LaSiFe$_{12}$ and the hydrogenated alloy to infer changes in magneto-elastic coupling and in phonon entropy on heating through $T_C$ by calculating the fermionic entropy due to the itinerant electrons. Lastly, we predict the electron thermopower in a spin-mixing, high temperature limit and compare our findings to recent literature data.</summary>

    <title>Quantum valence bond ice theory for proton-driven quantum spin-dipole liquids</title>

    <summary>We present a theory of a hybrid quantum liquid state, $\textit{quantum spin-dipole liquid}$ (QSDL), in a hydrogen-bonded electron system, by combining a quantum proton ice and Anderson's resonating valence bond spin liquid theory, motivated by the recent experimental discovery of a quantum spin liquid with proton fluctuations in $κ$-H$_3$(Cat-EDT-TTF)$_2$ (a.k.a. H-Cat). In our theory, an electron spin liquid and a proton dipole liquid are realized simultaneously in the ground state called $\textit{quantum valence bond ice}$. In this state, neither of them can be established independently of the other. Analytical and numerical calculations reveal that this state has a large entanglement entropy between spins and dipoles, which is far beyond the (crude) Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We also examine the stability of QSDL with respect to perturbations and discuss implications for experiments in H-Cat and its deuterated analog D-Cat.</summary>

    <title>The Grüneisen parameter applied to critical phenomena and experimental investigations of correlated phenomena in molecular conductors</title>

    <summary>In this Ph.D. Thesis, a systematic review is performed on the derivation and generalization of the Grüneisen parameter followed by its unprecedented applications to several distinct scenarios, such as magnetic model systems, zero-field quantum phase transitions, the maximization of caloric effects close to any critical-end point based on entropy arguments, the here-proposed adiabatic magnetization of a paramagnetic salt, as well as for Cosmology in the frame of the universe expansion. Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between theoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of correlated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the (TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$, SbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered suitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering, spin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a possible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static (low-frequency) dielectric constant $\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function of temperature where a maximum in $\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature was observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both hydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman measurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing a possible magneto-optical effect on the $ν_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the TMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the fully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence background, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the 97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.</summary>
