    <summary>Recently, Morishima, Futamase and Shimizu published a series of manuscripts, putting forward arguments, based on a post-Newtonian approximative calculation, that there can be a sizable general relativistic (GR) correction in the experimental determination of the muon magnetic moment based on spin precession, i.e., in muon g-2 experiments. In response, other authors argued that the effect must be much smaller than claimed. Further authors argued that the effect exactly cancels. Also, the known formulae for de Sitter and Lense-Thirring effect do not apply due to the non-geodesic motion. All this indicates that it is difficult to estimate from first principles the influence of GR corrections in the problem of spin propagation. Therefore, in this paper we present a full general relativistic calculation in order to quantify this effect. The main methodology is the purely differential geometrical tool of Fermi-Walker transport over a Schwarzschild background. Also the Larmor precession due to the propagation in the electromagnetic field of the experimental apparatus is included. For the muon g-2 experiments the GR correction turns out to be very small, well below the present sensitivity. However, in other similar storage ring experimental settings, such as electric dipole moment (EDM) search experiments, where the so-called frozen spin method is used, GR gives a well detectable effect, and should be corrected for. All frozen spin scenarios are affected which intend to reach a sensitivity of 0.1 microradians/second for the spin precession in the vertical plane.</summary>

    <summary>The quantum behavior of light nuclei and other particles in materials challenges classical intuition and introduces novel phenomena. Here we demonstrate that muon spin spectroscopy ( $μ$SR) is a powerful tool for exploring the quantum effects of light particles, such as the muon, in condensed matter. The muon's quantum nature is profoundly influenced by the surrounding, offering a unique probe for understanding the role of light atoms and their role in shaping local electronic environments. In Zn-barlowite, a candidate quantum spin liquid, we show that standard density functional theory (DFT) methods, which treat the muon as a classical point-like particle, fail to capture its strong quantum anharmonic effects. Only by modeling the muon as a spatially extended quantum particle, thus accounting for the anharmonicity, can the experimental $μ$SR data be understood. This approach not only improves the interpretation of $μ$SR results but also opens the door to studying the quantum effects of other light particles, like hydrogen and lithium nuclei, which can greatly influence material properties.</summary>

    <summary>In muon spin rotation experiments the positive implanted muon vibrates with large zero point amplitude by virtue of its light mass. Quantum mechanical calculations of the host material usually treat the muon as a point impurity, ignoring this large vibrational amplitude. As a first order correction, the muon zero point motion is usually described within the harmonic approximation, despite the large anharmonicity of the crystal potential. Here we apply the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, a quantum variational method devised to include strong anharmonic effects in total energy and vibrational frequency calculations, in order to overcome these limitations and provide an accurate ab initio description of the quantum nature of the muon. We applied this full quantum treatment to the calculation of the muon contact hyperfine field in textbook-case metallic systems, such as Fe, Ni, Co including MnSi and MnGe, significantly improving agreement with experiments. Our results show that muon vibrational frequencies are strongly renormalized by anharmonicity. Finally, in contrast to the harmonic approximation, we show that including quantum anharmonic fluctuations, the muon stabilizes at the octahedral site in bcc Fe.</summary>
