    <summary>  We compute the one-loop partition function for quadratic tachyon background in open string theory.
  Both closed and open string representations are developed. Using these representations we study the one-loop divergences in the partition function in the presence of the tachyon background. The divergences due to the open and closed string tachyons are treated by analytic continuation in the tachyon mass squared. We pay particular attention to the imaginary part of the analytically continued expressions. The last one gives the decay rate of the unstable vacuum. The dilaton tadpole is also given some partial consideration. The partition function is further used to study corrections to tachyon condensation processes describing brane descent relations. Assuming the boundary string field theory prescription for construction of the string field action via partition function holds at one loop level we study the one-loop corrections to the tachyon potential and to the tensions of lower-dimensional branes.</summary>

    <summary>  Certain configurations of D-branes, for example wrong dimensional branes or the brane-antibrane system, are unstable to decay. This instability is described by the appearance of a tachyonic mode in the spectrum of open strings ending on the brane(s). The decay of these unstable systems is described by the rolling of the tachyon field from the unstable maximum to the minimum of its potential. We analytically study the dynamics of the inhomogeneous tachyon field as it rolls towards the true vacuum of the theory in the context of several different tachyon effective actions. We find that the vacuum dynamics of these theories is remarkably similar and in particular we show that in all cases the tachyon field forms caustics where second and higher derivatives of the field blow up. The formation of caustics signals a pathology in the evolution since each of the effective actions considered is not reliable in the vicinity of a caustic. We speculate that the formation of caustics is an artifact of truncating the tachyon action, which should contain all orders of derivatives acting on the field, to a finite number of derivatives. Finally, we consider inhomogeneous solutions in p-adic string theory, a toy model of the bosonic tachyon which contains derivatives of all orders acting on the field. For a large class of initial conditions we conclusively show that the evolution is well behaved in this case. It is unclear if these caustics are a genuine prediction of string theory or not.</summary>

    <summary>In a linear dilaton background, it has been argued that an unstable D-brane can decay to the tachyon vacuum without leaving behind a remnant of tachyon matter. Here we address the question of how the D-brane can decay to the tachyon vacuum when the tachyon vacuum does not support physical fluctuations. Using the formalism of open string field theory, we find that the tachyon vacuum {\it can} support fluctuations provided they are "hidden" as nonperturbative effects behind a pure gauge asymptotic series.</summary>
