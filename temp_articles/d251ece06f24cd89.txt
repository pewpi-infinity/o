    <summary>The analysis of nonlinear interaction of transversal electromagnetic field with quantum collisionless plasma is carried out. Formulas for calculation electric current in quantum collisionless plasma at any temperature are deduced. It has appeared, that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence of the longitudinal electric current directed along a wave vector. This second current is orthogonal to the known transversal classical current, received at the classical linear analysis. The case of degenerate electronic plasma is considered. It is shown, that for degenerate plasmas the electric current is calculated under the formula, not containing quadratures. In this formula we have allocated known Kohn's singularities (W. Kohn, 1959).</summary>

    <summary>  Plasma toroidal metric singularities in helical devices and tokamaks, giving rise to magnetic surfaces inside the plasma devices are investigated in two cases. In the first we consider the case of a rotational plasma on an helical device with circular cross-section and dissipation. In this case singularities are shown to place a Ricci scalar curvature bound on the radius of the surface where the Ricci scalar is the contraction of the constant Riemannian curvature tensor of magnetic surfaces. An upper bound on the initial magnetic field in terms of the Ricci scalar is obtained. This last bound may be useful in the engineering construction of plasma devices in laboratories. The normal poloidal drift velocity is also computed. In the second case a toroidal metric is used to show that there is a relation between singularities and the type of tearing instabilities considered in the tokamak. Besides, in this case Ricci collineations and Killing symmetries are computed.The pressure is computed by applying these constraints to the pressure equations in tokamaks.</summary>

    <summary>The analysis of nonlinear interaction of transversal electromagnetic field with quantum collisionless plasma is carried out. Formulas for calculation electric current in quantum collisionless plasma at any temperature are deduced. It has appeared, that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence of the longitudinal electric current directed along a wave vector. This second current is orthogonal to the known transversal classical current, received at the classical linear analysis. The case of degenerate electronic plasma is considered. The concept of longitudinal-transversal conductivity is entered. The graphic analysis of the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless coefficient of longitudinal-transversal conductivity is made. It is shown, that for degenerate plasmas the electric current is calculated under the formula, not containing quadratures. In this formula we have allocated known Kohn's singularities (W. Kohn, 1959).</summary>
