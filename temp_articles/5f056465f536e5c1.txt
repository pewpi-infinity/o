    <summary>We propose a scenario where only the Higgs multiplets have direct couplings to a supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking sector. The standard model matter multiplets as well as the gauge multiples are sequestered from the SUSY breaking sector; therefore, their masses arise via anomaly mediation at the high energy scale with a gravitino mass of $\sim$100 TeV. Due to renormalization group running effects from the Higgs soft masses, the masses of the third generation sfermions become O(10) TeV at the low energy scale, while the first and second generation sfermion masses are O(0.1-1) TeV, avoiding the tachyonic slepton problem and flavor changing neutral current problem. With the splitting mass spectrum, the muon g-2 anomaly is explained consistently with the observed Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. Moreover, the third generation Yukawa couplings are expected to be unified in some regions.</summary>

    <title>Inverted effective SUSY with combined Z' and gravity mediation, and muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>

    <summary>Effective supersymmetry(SUSY) where stop is the lightest squark may run into a two-loop tachyonic problem in some Z' mediation models. In addition, a large A term or/and a large stop mass are needed to have about a 126 GeV Higgs boson with three families of quarks and leptons. Thus, we suggest an inverted effective SUSY(IeffSUSY) where stop mass is larger compared to those of the first two families. In this case, it is possible to have a significant correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon. A three family IeffSUSY in a Z' mediation scenario is explicitly studied with the Z' quantum number related to B-L. Here, we adopt both the Z' mediation and gravity mediation where the Z' mediation is the dominant one for stop, while the gravity mediation is the dominant one for the muonic leptons and Higgs multiplets. We present a numerical study based on a specific anomaly free model, and show the existence of the parameter region where all the phenomenological conditions are satisfied.</summary>

    <title>Non-holomorphic Contributions in GMSB with Adjoint Messengers</title>

    <summary>We consider models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, in which the breaking is transmitted to the visible sector by the messenger fields from the adjoint representation of MSSM's gauge group. We include the non-holomorphic terms induced by the supersymmetry breaking and involve them in the renormalization group evolution. The main impact from the non-holomorphic terms arises in the right-handed stau mass, which requires large hypercharge interactions with the messengers to accommodate non-tachyonic staus. With the non-holomorphic terms, the stau mass-square can remain positive in the renormalization group evolution, even if the hypercharge interactions are small. Although the radiative non-holomorphic contributions enhance the mass spectrum, their effects in the sparticle mixing rather reduce their overall contributions such that we realize about 25 GeV difference in the right-handed stau mass, while the difference is lowered by about 5 TeV in the lightest mass-eigenstate of staus. We realize 6-7 TeV difference in the sbottom mass, and about 15 TeV in the stop mass. These contributions in the sparticle masses also affect the SM-like Higgs boson mass, and we find that the SM-like Higgs boson can be enhanced as much as about 80 GeV. In a small region of the parameter space we also observe negative non-holomorphic contributions which do not exceed about 1 TeV for the sparticles, and 20 GeV for the SM-like Higgs boson. An interesting impact from the non-holomorphic terms happens in the muon g-2 results. We find that the non-holomorphic contributions can provide a significant decreasing in supersymmetric contributions to muon g-2. We realize that the muon g-2 results can be decreased as much as about -50 x 10^-10 by the non-holomorphic contributions, and consequently one can still accommodate light sleptons and gauginos in the spectrum.</summary>
