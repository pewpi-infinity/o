    <summary>We investigate the magnetic and superconducting properties in electron-doped Li$_x$HfNCl. HfNCl is a band insulator that undergoes an insulator to superconductor transition upon doping at $x\approx0.13$. The persistence of the insulating state for $x&lt;0.13$ is due to an Anderson transition probably related to Li disorder. In the metallic and superconducting phase, Li$_x$HfNCl is a prototype two-dimensional two-valley electron gas with parabolic bands. By performing a model random phase approximation approach as well as first-principles range-separated Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) calculations, we find that the spin susceptibility $χ_s$ is strongly enhanced in the low doping regime by the electron-electron interaction. Furthermore, in the low doping limit, the exchange interaction renormalizes the intervalley electron-phonon coupling and results in a strong increase of the superconducting critical temperature for $x&lt;0.15$. On the contrary, for $x&gt;0.15$, $T_c$ is approximately constant, in agreement with experiments. At $x=0.055$ we found that $T_c$ can be as large as 40 K, suggesting that the synthesis of cleaner samples of Li$_x$HfNCl could remove the Anderson insulating state competing with superconductivity and generate a high-$T_c$ superconductor.</summary>

    <title>MgCNi3: a conventional and yet puzzling superconductor</title>

    <summary>  The newly discovered superconductivity in MgCNi3, though with Tc&lt;8 K lower than that of the celebrated MgB2, is probably even more interesting in its many puzzling physical properties. MgCNi3 has been theoretically speculated to be unstable towards ferromagnetism. However, there are numerous evidences from the specific heat C(T), Tunneling spectroscopy and NMR experiments indicating conventional s-wave superconductivity in MgCNi3. The Hall effect and the thermoelectric power experiments suggest that the carriers responsible for the transport properties are electrons, in obvious contrast to holes predicated by the band structure calculations. In this article, we report the results of C(T) experiments, upper critical field Hc2 measurements, and the pressure effects on MgCNi3. These experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that superconductivity in MgCNi3 is well explained within the conventional electron-phonon interaction scenario, at most with minor modifications from the magnetic interaction. The thermodynamic data C(T) is consistent with the conventional s-wave order parameter. Hc2 of all samples follows a universal WHH relation . Surprisingly, dTc/dP is positive which leaves room for further improvements in band structure calculations. There are other serious discrepancies between experiments and theory like in the transport properties and x-ray photoemission. The possible reconciliation within the two-band model and the consequent difficulties are discussed.</summary>

    <title>Electronic structure and properties of superconducting materials with simple Fermi surfaces</title>

    <summary>The electronic structures of the ground state for several different superconducting materials, such as cuprates, conventional 3-dimensional superconductors, doped semiconductors and low-dimensional systems, are quite different and sometimes in contrast to what is supposed to make a superconductor. Properties like the Fermi-surface (FS) topology, density-of-states (DOS), stripes, electron-phonon coupling ($λ_{ep}$) and spin fluctuations ($λ_{sf}$) are analyzed in order to find clues to what might be important for the mechanism of superconductivity. A high DOS at $E_F$ is important for standard estimates of $λ's$, but it is suggested that superconductivity can survive a low DOS if the FS is simple enough. Superconducting fluctuations are plausible from coupling to long wave length modes in underdoped cuprates, where short coherence length is a probable obstacle for long-range superconductivity. Thermal disorder is recognized as a limiting factor for large $T_C$ independently of doping.</summary>
