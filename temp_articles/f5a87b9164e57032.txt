    <summary>A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$, transfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus. The energy lost by electron is more than the energy gained by the nucleus. The resulting energy goes in exciting the atom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon, mercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber experiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper, we study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering experiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth, why muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like lead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the elastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron microscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these phenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give Bloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give resistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and superconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in Fermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures. Electron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions. We turn our attention to electron-proton scattering both eleastic and inelastic, as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and understand the independence of ineleastic cross-section of with respect to transferred momentum. We see, why we can just say that there are three quarks in proton from elastic cross-section. Our main contribution in this article is we are detailed at places, we find literature terse.</summary>

    <title>Antiferromagnetic properties of a water vapor-inserted $YBa_2Cu_3O_{6.5}$ compound studied by NMR, NQR and $μ$ SR</title>

    <summary>  We present a detailed NQR, NMR and $μ$SR study of a magnetic phase obtained during a topotactic chemical reaction of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.5}$ high- temperature superconductor with low-pressure water vapor. Our studies give straightforward evidence that the ''empty'' Cu(1) chains play the role of an easy water insertion channel. It is shown that the NQR spectrum of the starting material transforms progressively under insertion of water, and completely disappears when one H$_{2}$O molecule is inserted per unit cell. Similarly, a Cu ZFNMR signal characteristic of this water inserted material appears and grows with increasing water content, which indicates that the products of the reaction are non-superconducting antiferromagnetic phases in which the bilayers are ordered. These antiferromagnetic phases are felt by proton NMR which reveals two sites with static internal fields of 150 and about 15 Gauss respectively. Two muon sites are also evidenced with similar local fields which vanish at $T\approx 400$ K. This indicates that the magnetic phases have similar Néel temperatures as the other bilayer undoped compounds. An analysis of the internal fields on different sites of the structure suggests that they can be all assigned to a single magnetic phase at large water content in which the Cu(1) electron spins order with those of the Cu(2). It appears that even samples packed in Stycast epoxy resin heated moderately at a temperature (200$^{0}$C) undergo a reaction with epoxy decomposition products which yield the formation of the same final compound. It is then quite clear that such effects should be considered quite seriously and avoided in experiments attempting to resolve tiny effects in such materials, as those performed in some recent neutron scattering experiments.</summary>

    <title>Coexistence of Kondo Coherence and Localized Magnetic Moments in the Normal State of Molten Salt-Flux Grown UTe2</title>

    <summary>The development of Kondo lattice coherence in UTe2 leads to the formation of a heavy Fermi liquid state from which superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</summary>
