    <summary>Technical applications using electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) need a formula for the rate-constant K_e for the free-space ESFI of a hydrogenic atom in its ground electronic state. This formula must indicate the dependence on ionization energy I. Existing formulae were derived using atomic units. However, many scientists work with ESFI as an important technical process, but are not familiar with the Gaussian or atomic units systems. In the 1970s, the present International System of Quantities (ISQ), which includes the equations behind SI units, was designated as the main system for university teaching and the communication of scientific equations. 40 years on, ISQ derivations of ESFI rate-constant formulae are still not easily found, but are now needed. This tutorial paper gives a detailed ISQ derivation of a formula for K_e. The derivation is closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz (LL) approach used in their 1958 work (in atomic units) on hydrogen atom ESFI. The ISQ derivation confirms that, for hydrogenic atoms, ionization energy appears in the pre-exponential as I^(5/2), and defines a universal "field ionization constant". It also shows how the ISQ formula relates to the Gurney and Condon "attempt frequency" form for tunnelling rate-constants, and an ISQ formula is given for the motive energy in the related JWKB integral. The ISQ derivation uses a motive-energy transformation analogous to a transformation used by LL. The need for this transformation in ESFI theory raises questions as to the correctness of theoretical treatments of field electron emission from non-planar emitters, which do not make this transformation.</summary>

    <arxiv:comment>41 typed pages (double-line spacing). In v4, an interpretation error in earlier versions has been corrected, and there has been a change in emphasis. The paper is now presented as an ISQ treatment of the ESFI of a hydrogenic atom, with the treatment closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz atomic-units treatment of the ESFI of a hydrogen atom. In consequence, the title has been changed</arxiv:comment>

    <title>Cosmological Hydrogen Recombination: influence of resonance and electron scattering</title>
    <updated>2009-04-15T17:25:15Z</updated>

    <summary>  In this paper we consider the effects of resonance and electron scattering on the escape of Lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination. We pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening using a Fokker-Planck approximation of the redistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the Lyman alpha resonance of moving hydrogen atoms. We extend the computations of our recent paper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics of hydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence of the problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to a frequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, and the quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the 3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the Lyman alpha emission profile. We show here that due to the redistribution of photons over frequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by DN_e/N_e~-0.6% at z~900. For the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra this results in |DC_l/C_l|~0.5%-1% at l &gt;~ 1500, and therefore will be important for the analysis of future CMB data in the context of the PLANCK Surveyor, SPT and ACT. The main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoil effect (DN_e/N_e~-1.2% at z~900), while Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening partially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down by DN_e/N_e~0.6% at z~900. The influence of electron scattering close to the maximum of the Thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected. (abridged)</summary>
