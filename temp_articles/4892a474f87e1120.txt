    <summary>  In this paper we consider the effects of resonance and electron scattering on the escape of Lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination. We pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening using a Fokker-Planck approximation of the redistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the Lyman alpha resonance of moving hydrogen atoms. We extend the computations of our recent paper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics of hydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence of the problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to a frequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, and the quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the 3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the Lyman alpha emission profile. We show here that due to the redistribution of photons over frequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by DN_e/N_e~-0.6% at z~900. For the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra this results in |DC_l/C_l|~0.5%-1% at l &gt;~ 1500, and therefore will be important for the analysis of future CMB data in the context of the PLANCK Surveyor, SPT and ACT. The main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoil effect (DN_e/N_e~-1.2% at z~900), while Doppler boosting and Doppler broadening partially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down by DN_e/N_e~0.6% at z~900. The influence of electron scattering close to the maximum of the Thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected. (abridged)</summary>

    <title>Electromagnetic particle-in-cell modeling of an electron cyclotron resonance plasma discharge in hydrogen</title>

    <summary>A low pressure discharge sustained in molecular hydrogen with help of the electron cyclotron resonance heating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is simulated using a fully electromagnetic implicit charge- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo code. The simulations show a number of kinetic effects, and the results are in good agreement with various experimentally measured data such as electron density, electron temperature and degree of dissociation. The electron energy distribution shows a tri-Maxwellian form due to a number of different electron heating mechanisms, agreeing with the experimental data in the measured electron energy interval. The simulation results are also verified against a drift-diffusion model and proximity is observed between the computational results for the plasma density at the location of experimental measurement. However, the fluid approximation fails to accurately predict radical density and electron temperature because of the assumption of a single electron temperature. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of hydrogen radicals, whose production is strongly underestimated by the fluid model, whereas it is well predicted by the model considered here. The energy distribution of such radicals demonstrates the presence of a relatively large number of energetic hydrogen atoms produced by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The new insights are of significance for practical applications of hydrogen plasmas.</summary>

    <title>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma characterization based on simple optical emission spectroscopy</title>

    <summary>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma measurements based on simple optical emission spectroscopy on a new compact low current ion source designed and built by the authors is presented. By observing the plasma luminescence both directly and through a low-cost transmission diffraction grating, basic characterization of the Hydrogen plasma obtainable in the ion source is carried out. Through simple processing of CCD captures of these images, optimal values for the ion source relevant operation parameters, including RF power and frequency, and Hydrogen mass flow are easily obtained. Despite the simplicity of the method and its limited accuracy as compared to the use of a full standard optical spectrometric set-up, it is shown that the presented approach can cope with basic plasma diagnostic tasks as far as the successful operation of the ion source is concerned.</summary>
