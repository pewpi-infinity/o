    <summary>In this study the tachyon-like Dirac equation, formulated by Chodos to describe superluminal neutrino, is solved. The analytical solutions are Gaussian wave packets obtained using the envelope method. It is shown that the superluminal neutrino behaves like a pseudo-tachyon, namely a particle with subluminal velocity and pure imaginary mass that fulfils the energy-momentum relation typical of classical tachyons. The obtained results are used to prove that the trembling motion of the particle position around the median, known as Zitterbewegung, also takes place for the superluminal neutrino, even if the oscillation velocity is always lower than the speed of light. Finally, the pseudo-tachyon wave packet is used to calculate the probability of oscillation between mass states, obtaining a formula analogous to the one obtained for the ordinary neutrino. This suggest that in the experiments concerning neutrino oscillation is not possible to distinguish tachyonic neutrinos from ordinary ones.</summary>

    <title>Explanation on Negative Mass-Square of Neutrinos</title>

    <summary>  It has been known for many years that the measured mass-square of neutrino is probably negative. For solving this puzzle, we have further investigated the hypothesis that neutrinos are superluminal fermions. A new Dirac-type equation is proposed and a tachyonic quantum theory is briefly discussed. This equation is equivalent to two Weyl equations coupled together via nonzero mass while respecting the maximum parity violation, and it reduces to one Weyl equation when the neutrino mass becomes zero.</summary>

    <title>Perfect Structure of the Special Relativity, Superluminal, Neutrino-Photon Mass and New Entangled Interaction</title>

    <summary>First, some superluminal phenomena and experiments are introduced briefly. Next, based on the basic principles of the special relativity, the Lorentz transformation (LT) with smaller velocity and the general Lorentz transformation (GLT) with larger velocity should be derived simultaneously by the classification of the timelike and the spacelike intervals. In deriving LT, an additional independent hypothesis has been used, thus the values of velocity are restricted absolutely, and the spacelike interval is excluded. LT and GLT are connected by the de Broglie relation. The fundamental properties of any four-vector and the strange characteristic which these tachyons should possess are described. The various superluminal transformations are discussed. Further, we think that LT is unsuitable for photon and neutrino, the photon transformation (PT) is unified for space and time. It may reasonably overcome some existing difficulties, and cannot restrict that the rest mass of photon and neutrino must be zero. LT, GLT and PT together form a complete structure of the Lorentz group. Finally, we discuss that new experiments on the quantum entangled state shown some characters, for example, coherency, nonlocality, quantum teleportation and superluminal. Further, it should be a new fifth interaction, and may probably apply GLT.</summary>
