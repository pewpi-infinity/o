    <summary>To avoid reflectivity losses in ITER optical diagnostic systems, plasma sputtering of metallic First Mirrors is foreseen in order to remove deposits coming from the main wall (mainly beryllium and tungsten). Therefore plasma cleaning has to work on large mirrors (up to a size of 200*300 mm) and under the influence of strong magnetic fields (several Tesla). This work presents the results of plasma cleaning of aluminium and aluminium oxide (used as beryllium proxy) deposited on molybdenum mirrors. Using radio frequency (13.56 MHz) argon plasma, the removal of a 260 nm mixed aluminium/aluminium oxide film deposited by magnetron sputtering on a mirror (98 mm diameter) was demonstrated. 50 nm of pure aluminium oxide were removed from test mirrors (25 mm diameter) in a magnetic field of 0.35 T for various angles between the field lines and the mirrors surfaces. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated by performing reflectivity measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.</summary>

    <title>Plasma-Metal Junction:A Junction With Negative Turn-On Voltage</title>

    <summary>Unlike junctions in solid-state devices, a plasma-metal junction (pm-junction) is a junction of classical and quantum electrons. The plasma electrons are Maxwellain in nature, while metal electrons obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In this experiment, the current-voltage characteristics of solid-state devices that form homo or hetero-junction are compared to the pm-junction. Observation shows that the turn-on voltage for pn-junction is 0.5V and decreases to 0.24V for metal-semiconductor junction. However, the pm-junction's turn-on voltage was lowered to a negative value of -7.0V. The devices with negative turn-on voltage are suitable for high-frequency operations. Further, observations show that the current-voltage characteristics of the pm-junction depend on the metal's work function, and the turn-on voltage remains unchanged. This result validates the applicability of the energy-band model for the pm-junction. We present a perspective metal-oxide-plasma (MOP), a gaseous electronic device, as an alternative to metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS), based on the new understanding developed.</summary>

    <title>A disclosure of the role of frequency on the plasma electrolytic oxidation of AZ31 magnesium alloy in aluminate-tungstate electrolyte</title>

    <summary>Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) was carried out to form black ceramic coatings on AZ31 magnesium alloy in aluminate-tungstate electrolyte. Influences of current frequency (such as 100, 1000 and 2000 Hz) on properties of the PEO coatings have been explored. It was found that increment of frequency led to coatings with higher thickness, higher roughness and darker appearance. In order to explore the coating formation mechanism at different frequencies, the micro-discharges at different frequencies were investigated by real-time imaging method. Microstructure of coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assisted with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Coatings formed at 100 Hz show the most compact microstructure while porosity of the coatings, both in the pore number and pore size, is greatly increased at higher frequencies. The coatings formed at higher frequencies show an increased atomic ratio of W/Al. The cancel of the negative pulse from the pulsed waveform can also lead to a higher W/Al ratio, and hence a darker coating. The higher porosity of the coatings was attributed to the stronger plasma discharges and gas evolution at higher frequencies. The stronger plasma discharge is induced by the fact that there is not sufficient time for the cooling down of discharge channels at higher frequencies.</summary>
