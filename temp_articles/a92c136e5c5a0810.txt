    <summary>  We prove an explicit condition on the level $k$ for the irreducibility of a vacuum module $V^{k}$ over a (non-twisted) affine Lie superalgebra, which was conjectured by M. Gorelik and V.G. Kac. An immediate consequence of this work is the simplicity conditions for the corresponding minimal W-algebras obtained via quantum reduction, in all cases except when the level $k$ is a non-negative integer.</summary>

    <summary>One technique for creating semiconductor crystals with new, desired properties involves replacing some atoms in the crystal lattice with additives - atoms of a different type. This substitution not only alters the bulk properties of the crystal but also affects the patterns formed on its surface. A surface that is smooth and regular in a uniform crystal can become bunched or meandered under the same growth conditions if some atoms are replaced by additives. The Vicinal Cellular Automaton (VicCA) model is used to study this behavior, analyzing the mechanism of pattern formation when additives are introduced into the system. It has also been shown that the newly formed structures resulting from the presence of additives can be smoothed by applying successive layers of a homogeneous composition on top for a sufficiently long time. Additives can also act as smoothing agents for bunched or meandered surface patterns that develop in a homogeneous crystal. However, their effectiveness diminishes for spatially extended patterns such as nanowires. Typically, when homogeneous crystal layers are applied to spatial structures, the resulting surface is not entirely smoothed but instead transforms into a distinct shape. This phenomenon is demonstrated, and its underlying mechanism is thoroughly analyzed.</summary>

    <title>Effects of anisotropy in a nonlinear crystal for squeezed vacuum generation</title>

    <summary>Squeezed vacuum (SV) can be obtained by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) with the quantum vacuum state at the input. We are interested in a degenerate type-I OPA based on parametric down-conversion (PDC) where due to phase matching requirements, an extraordinary polarized pump must impinge onto a birefringent crystal with a large χ(2) nonlinearity. As a consequence of the optical anisotropy of the medium, the direction of propagation of the pump wavevector does not coincide with the direction of propagation of its energy, an effect known as transverse walk-off. For certain pump sizes and crystal lengths, the transverse walk-off has a strong influence on the spatial spectrum of the generated radiation, which in turn affects the outcome of any experiment in which this radiation is employed. In this work we propose a method that reduces the distortions of the two-photon amplitude (TPA) of the states considered, by using at least two consecutive crystals instead of one. We show that after anisotropy compensation the TPA becomes symmetric, allowing for a simple Schmidt expansion, a procedure that in practice requires states that come from experimental systems free of anisotropy effects.</summary>
