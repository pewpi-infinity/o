    <summary>  The angular distribution of the emitted electrons, following the two--photon ionization of the hydrogen--like ions, is studied within the framework of second order perturbation theory \textit{and} the Dirac equation. Using a density matrix approach, we have investigated the effects which arise from the polarization of the incoming light as well as from the higher multipoles in the expansion of the electron--photon interaction. For medium-- and high--Z ions, in particular, the non--dipole contributions give rise to a significant change in the angular distribution of the emitted electrons, if compared with the electric--dipole approximation. This includes a strong forward emission while, in dipole approximation, the electron emission always occurs symmetric with respect to the plane which is perpendicular to the photon beam. Detailed computations for the dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on the polarization of the incident light are carried out for the ionization of the H, Xe$^{53+}$ and U$^{91+}$ (hydrogen--like) ions.</summary>

    <summary>The temperature dependence of rates of electron impact ionization and two electrons recombination are calculated using Wannier cross section of electron impact ionization of neutral hydrogen atom. Entropy production and power dissipation are derived for the case when the ionization degree deviates from its equilibrium value. This is the special case of the obtained general formula for entropy production accompanying chemical reactions. Damping rate of the sound waves is calculated and the conditions when ionization processes dominate are considered. A quasi-classical approximation for the heating mechanism of solar chromosphere is proposed. Several analogous phenomena for damping rates in liquids and crystals are shortly discussed, for example, deaf sound of a glass of beer or English salt solution. An explicit expression for the second or bulk (or volume) viscosity of hydrogen plasma is calculated from firsts principles. For the first time some second viscosity is calculated from first principles.</summary>

    <title>ISQ derivation ("derivation in SI units") of a formula for the electrostatic field ionization rate-constant for a hydrogenic atom in its ground electronic state</title>

    <summary>Technical applications using electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) need a formula for the rate-constant K_e for the free-space ESFI of a hydrogenic atom in its ground electronic state. This formula must indicate the dependence on ionization energy I. Existing formulae were derived using atomic units. However, many scientists work with ESFI as an important technical process, but are not familiar with the Gaussian or atomic units systems. In the 1970s, the present International System of Quantities (ISQ), which includes the equations behind SI units, was designated as the main system for university teaching and the communication of scientific equations. 40 years on, ISQ derivations of ESFI rate-constant formulae are still not easily found, but are now needed. This tutorial paper gives a detailed ISQ derivation of a formula for K_e. The derivation is closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz (LL) approach used in their 1958 work (in atomic units) on hydrogen atom ESFI. The ISQ derivation confirms that, for hydrogenic atoms, ionization energy appears in the pre-exponential as I^(5/2), and defines a universal "field ionization constant". It also shows how the ISQ formula relates to the Gurney and Condon "attempt frequency" form for tunnelling rate-constants, and an ISQ formula is given for the motive energy in the related JWKB integral. The ISQ derivation uses a motive-energy transformation analogous to a transformation used by LL. The need for this transformation in ESFI theory raises questions as to the correctness of theoretical treatments of field electron emission from non-planar emitters, which do not make this transformation.</summary>

    <arxiv:comment>41 typed pages (double-line spacing). In v4, an interpretation error in earlier versions has been corrected, and there has been a change in emphasis. The paper is now presented as an ISQ treatment of the ESFI of a hydrogenic atom, with the treatment closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz atomic-units treatment of the ESFI of a hydrogen atom. In consequence, the title has been changed</arxiv:comment>
