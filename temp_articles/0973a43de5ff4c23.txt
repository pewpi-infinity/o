    <summary>Magnesium hydride has great potential as a solid hydrogen (H) storage material because of its high H storage capacity of 7.6 wt%. However, its slow hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and the high temperature of 300 $^\circ$C required for decomposition are major obstacles to small-scale applications such as automobiles. The local electronic structure of interstitial H in MgH$_2$ is an important fundamental knowledge in solving this problem, which has been studied mainly based on density functional theory (DFT). However, few experimental studies have been performed to assess the results of DFT calculations. We have therefore introduced muon (Mu) as pseudo-H into MgH$_2$ and investigated the corresponding interstitial H states by analyzing their electronic and dynamical properties in detail. As a result, we observed multiple Mu states similar to those observed in wide-gap oxides, and found that their electronic states can be attributed to relaxed-excited states associated with donor/acceptor levels predicted by the recently proposed "ambipolarity model". This provides an indirect support for the DFT calculations on which the model is based via the donor/acceptor levels. An important implication of the muon results for improved hydrogen kinetics is that dehydrogenation, serving as a $reduction$ for hydrides, stabilizes the interstitial H$^-$ state.</summary>

    <title>Electronic structure of interstitial hydrogen in In-Ga-Zn-O semiconductor simulated by muon</title>

    <summary>We report on the local electronic structure of interstitial muon (Mu) as pseudo-hydrogen in In-Ga-Zn oxide (IGZO) semiconductor studied by muon spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) experiment. In polycrystalline (c-) IGZO, it is inferred that Mu is in a diamagnetic state, where the $μ$SR time spectra under zero external field is perfectly described by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function with the linewidth $Δ$ serving as a sensitive measure for the random local fields from In/Ga nuclear magnetic moments. The magnitude of $Δ$ combined with the density functional theory calculations for H (to mimic Mu) suggests that Mu occupies Zn-O bond-center site (Mu$_{\rm BC}$) similar to the case in crystalline ZnO. This implies that the diamagnetic state in c-IGZO corresponds to Mu$_{\rm BC}^+$, thus serving as an electron donor. In amorphous (a-) IGZO, the local Mu structure in as-deposited films is nearly identical with that in c-IGZO, suggesting Mu$_{\rm BC}^+$ for the electronic state. In contrast, the diamagnetic signal in heavily hydrogenated a-IGZO films exhibits the Lorentzian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation, implying that Mu accompanies more inhomogeneous distribution of the neighboring nuclear spins that may involve Mu$^-$H$^-$-complex state in an oxygen vacancy.</summary>

    <title>On the energy dependence of the muon transfer rate from hydrogen to oxygen</title>

    <summary>The results of calculations of the muon transfer rate from the 1S state of muonic hydrogen to the nucleus of a free oxygen atom are presented in the interval of collision energies from 10^(-4) to 10 eV. The calculations were performed within a version of the perturbed stationary states method proposed earlier. The electron screening in the entrance channel of the transfer reaction was taken into account. A p-wave resonance in the transfer rate is predicted at collision energies of about 0.1 eV. This result is of interest in the context of the planned laser experiment on precise measurements of the hyperfine splitting energy of the 1S state of muonic hydrogen.</summary>
