    <summary>The process of coherent creation of particle - hole excitations by an electric field in graphene is quantitatively described using a dynamic "first quantized" approach. We calculate the evolution of current density, number of pairs and energy in ballistic regime using the tight binding model. The series in electric field strength $E$ up to third order in both DC and AC are calculated. We show how the physics far from the two Dirac points enters various physical quantities in linear response and how it is related to the chiral anomaly. The third harmonic generation and the imaginary part of conductivity are obtained. It is shown that at certain time scale $t_{nl}\propto E^{-1/2}$ the physical behaviour dramatically changes and the perturbation theory breaks down. Beyond the linear response physics is explored using an exact solution of the first quantized equations. While for small electric fields the I-V curve is linear characterized by the universal minimal resistivity $σ=π/2(e^{2}/h)$%, at $t&gt;t_{nl}$ the conductivity grows fast. The copious pair creation (with rate $E^{3/2}$), analogous to Schwinger's electron - positron pair creation from vacuum in QED, leads to creation of the electron - hole plasma at ballistic times of order $t_{nl}$. This process is terminated by a relaxational recombination.</summary>

    <title>Casimir interaction between spherical and planar plasma sheets</title>

    <summary>We consider the interaction between a spherical plasma sheet and a planar plasma sheet due to the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields. We use the mode summation approach to derive the Casimir interaction energy and study its asymptotic behaviors. In the small separation regime, we confirm the proximity force approximation and calculate the first correction beyond the proximity force approximation. This study has potential application to model Casimir interaction between objects made of materials that can be modeled by plasma sheets such as graphene sheets.</summary>

    <title>Surface activation of Hastalex by vacuum argon plasma for cytocompatibility enhancement</title>

    <summary>Here, we present surface analysis and biocompatibility evaluation of novel composite material based on graphene oxide traded as Hastalex. First, the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the pristine material were examined by atomic force and scanning electron microscopies, and by energy-dispersive and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, respectively. The Hastalex surface was then modified by plasma, 3 and 8 W with exposure times up to 240 s, the impact of which on the material surface wettability and morphology was further evaluated. In addition, the material aging was studied at room and elevated temperatures. Significant changes in surface roughness, morphology, and area were detected at the nanometre scale after plasma exposure. An increase in oxygen content due to the plasma exposure was observed both for 3 and 8 W. The plasma treatment had an outstanding effect on the cytocompatibility of Hastalex foil treated at both input powers of 3 and 8 W. The cell number of human MRC 5 fibroblasts on Hastalex foils exposed to plasma increased significantly compared to pristine Hastalex and even to tissue culture polystyrene. The plasma exposure also affected the fibroblasts cell growth and shape.</summary>
