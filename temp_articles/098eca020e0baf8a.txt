    <summary>The structural, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of LaFeSiH$_x$ for $x$ between 0 and 1 are investigated using density functional calculations. We find that the electronic and magnetic properties are strongly controlled by the hydrogen concentration $x$ in LaFeSiH$_x$. While fully hydrogenated LaFeSiH has a striped antiferromagnetic ground state, the underdoped LaFeSiH$_x$ for $x\leq0.75$ is not magnetic within the virtual crystal approximation or with explicit doping of supercells. The antiferromagnetic configuration breaks the symmetry of Fe $d$ orbitals and increases electron-phonon coupling up to $50\%$, especially for modes in the 20-50 meV range that are associated with Fe atomic movement. We find competing nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions and significant spin-phonon coupling, qualitatively similar but smaller in magnitude compared those found in LaOFeAs superconductors. The superconducting $T_c$ for antiferromagnetic LaFeSiH$_x$, assuming conventional superconductivity via McMillan's equation, therefore is computed to be 2-10 K, in contrast to $T_c\approx0$ for the nonmagnetic material. We also predict that the LaFeSiH$_x$ could be a good proton conductor due to phase stability with a wide range of hydrogen concentration $x &lt; 1$.</summary>

    <title>Crystalline anisotropy induces a second antiferromagnetic phase in the absence of SDW in the heavily hydrogen-doped LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_x$ $(x\sim0.5 )$</title>

    <summary>Electronic and magnetic properties of the heavily H-doped LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_x$ $(x\sim0.5 )$ were studied in the framework of the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT). We found a stripe-like-ordered structure of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, as a ground state, with the same configuration as the antiferromagnetic (AF) order. The new configuration could explain the existing experimental results related to the heavily H-doped LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_x$, such as an in-plane electronic anisotropy and a non-uniform magnetic behavior. A significant anisotropy was observed between Fe- 3d$_{xz}$ (xz) and Fe-3d$_{yz}$ (yz) orbitals in the ground state in the absence of the pseudogap resulting from the spin density wave phase, which was found to originate from the crystalline anisotropy. Magnetic moments were not spatially uniform and were sensitive to the crystal configuration. We found that a non-uniform magnetic behavior is associated with the As-Fe-As bond angle in the structure. Our findings would clarify the importance of crystal details and orbital degrees of freedom in iron-based superconductors.</summary>

    <title>Three-Dimensional Real Space Invariants, Obstructed Atomic Insulators and A New Principle for Active Catalytic Sites</title>

    <summary>Topologically trivial insulators come in two kinds: atomic, where the Wannier charge centers (WCCs) are localized on the atoms, and obstructed atomic, where the WCCs are located away from the atoms. The latter, which can exhibit interesting surface states and possibly have much larger band gaps than the topological insulators, have so far not been classified in three-dimensional (3D) crystalline materials. In this paper, we developed the 3D real space invariants (RSIs) for the 1651 Shubnikov space groups with the spin-orbit coupling and provide the full classification of 3D obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) by the RSIs. We then apply the theory to the entire database of materials on the Topological Quantum Chemistry website and Topological Magnetic Materials website, obtaining all the OAIs so far existing in nature. We find that, out of the 34013 paramagnetic and 296 magnetic topologically trivial insulators, there are 3383 paramagnetic and 30 magnetic OAIs. All of them present a filling anomaly under certain open-boundary conditions and exhibit obstructed surface states (OSSs). We further refine the atomic insulator concept to obtain the orbital-selected OAIs (OOAIs), where the WCC of the system is located at a Wyckoff position occupied by an atom but forms a symmetric representation that does not belong to the outer-shell electrons of the given atom. In such a way, we obtain a further 121 OOAIs. Furthermore, we analyze the catalytic properties of one of the OAIs in a "proof of principle" experiment. By using the single crystal of 2H-MoS2 as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, we directly prove that the catalytic activities arise from the surfaces with OSSs. Additional potential applications of the 3D RSIs and OAIs in, for example, electrochemistry, asymmetric catalysis, superconductivity, and Josephson diode will be discussed.</summary>
