    <summary>Vapor growth of semiconductors is analyzed using recently obtained dependence of the adsorption energy on the electron charge transfer between the surface adsorbed species and the bulk [Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 114 (2013) 063507, Kempisty et al. ArXiv 1307.5778 (2013)]. Ab initio calculations were performed to study the physical properties of GaN(0001) surface in ammonia-rich conditions, i.e. covered by mixture of NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals. The Fermi level is pinned at valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) for full coverage by NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals, respectively. For the crossover content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer (ML), the Fermi level is unpinned. It was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping in the bulk for the unpinned Fermi level, i.e. for this coverage. Surface structure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and compared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by determination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic stability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial pressure steeply increases with NH3 content to attain the crossover NH3/NH2 coverage, i.e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition the entire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor growth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level at the surface, i.e. for flat bands. Accordingly, adsorption energy of most species depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible molecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of semiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk</summary>

    <summary>We present an investigation of chemical influences on the growth of ice crystals from water vapor. In one set of experiments, we grew ice crystals in a vapor diffusion chamber, observing crystal morphologies at temperatures from 0 C to -25 C in different background gases and with a variety of gaseous chemical additives. In a second set of experiments, we measured ice crystal growth rates at -5 C and -15 C in a free-fall flow chamber, using normal laboratory air and ultra-clean nitrogen gas, both with and without chemical additives. Conclusions from these experiments include:\ 1) In nitrogen gas at a pressure of one atmosphere, no tested chemical additives at concentrations below 10 ppm produced any observable changes in ice crystal growth morphologies; 2) Growth in ultra-clean nitrogen gas was not significantly different from growth in ordinary laboratory air; 3) Chemical additives affected plate-like dendritic growth at -15 C more readily than growth at higher temperatures; 4) Chemical additives tended to promote the growth of columnar crystals over plate-like crystals; 5) Ice growth in air, nitrogen, helium, argon, hydrogen, and methane gases at a pressure of one atmosphere yielded essentially the same temperature-dependent crystal morphologies.</summary>

    <title>Dominant Kinetic Pathways of Graphene Growth in Chemical Vapor Deposition: The Role of Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>The most popular way to produce graphene nowadays is chemical vapor deposition, where, surprisingly, H$_2$ gas is routinely supplied even though it is a byproduct itself. In this study, by identifying dominant growing pathways via multiscale simulations, we unambiguously reveal the central role hydrogen played in graphene growth. Hydrogen can saturate the edges of a growing graphene island to some extent, depending on the H$_2$ pressure. Although graphene etching by hydrogen has been observed in experiment, hydrogen saturation actually stabilizes graphene edges by reducing the detachment rates of carbon-contained species. Such a new picture well explains some puzzling experimental observations and is also instrumental in growth protocol optimization for two-dimensional atomic crystal van der Waals epitaxy.</summary>
