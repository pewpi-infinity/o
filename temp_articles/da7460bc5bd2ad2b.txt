    <summary>In the present paper we analyze the spectrum of quasinormal modes for massive scalar and Dirac fields, allowing for both tardyonic ($μ^2 &gt;0$) and tachyonic ($μ^2 &lt;0$) masses, in the expanding and rotating cosmological background. The spectrum found shows a number of peculiar features, which are absent in the Minkowski space-time. A hypothetical particle that moves faster than light, \emph{a tachyon}, is known to be classically unstable in the Minkowski space-time. This instability has its analog at the quantum level: small vacuum fluctuations of the field lead to the unbounded growth of the amplitude, so that the appearance of the real tachyons in the spectrum means that there is catastrophic instability in the theory. It has been conjectured a long time ago that possibly the lightest particles with nonzero mass, the neutrino, may be a tachyon. Here we shall show that in the rotating and expanding Universe tachyons are stable if their mass is less than some constant, which is related to the Universe's rotation and expansion scales. The current upper bound on the rotation scale gives us a very small upper bound on the tachyon's mass which is many orders less than the mass of the electron. This might explain why only very light particles have the chance of becoming tachyons. It is shown that the spectrum of the "normal" ($μ^2 &gt;0$) Dirac field has a discontinuity as a function of the z-component of the wave vector $k_z$ at $k_z = 0$. Keywords: OPERA, superluminal neutrino.</summary>

    <title>Towards a QED-Based Vacuum Energy</title>

    <summary>  A QED-based mechanism, breaking translational invariance of the vacuum at sufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for the vacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtual vacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fields corresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_μ^{ext} (x)$, which is itself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_μ(x)$ in the presence of that $A_μ^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equation for $A_μ^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solution corresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; this solution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on the order of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble is included; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 - 10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_μ$, whose magnitude is determined by a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observed acceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which the fields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysis suggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (corresponding to a "spontaneous vacuum phase change") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a "polarization of the QED vacuum" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum). Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing the possibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whose back-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. The possibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentum transfers is discussed.</summary>

    <title>Tachyons Before Tachyons: Lev Strum (1890-1936) and Superluminal Velocities</title>

    <summary>No particle or signal carrying information can travel at a speed exceeding that of light in vacuum. Although this has for a long time been accepted as a law of nature, prior to Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity the possibility of superluminal motion of electrons was widely discussed by Arnold Sommerfeld and other physicists. Besides, it is not obvious that special relativity rules out such motion under all circumstances. From approximately 1965 to 1985 the hypothesis of tachyons moving faster than light was seriously entertained by a minority of physicists. This paper reviews the early history concerning superluminal signals and pays particular attention to the ideas proposed in the 1920s by the little known Ukrainian physicist Lev Strum (Shtrum). As he pointed out in a paper of 1923, within the framework of relativity it is possible for a signal to move superluminally without violating the law of causality. Part of this article is devoted to the personal and scientific biography of the undeservedly neglected Strum, whose career was heavily and eventually fatally influenced by the political situation in Stalin's Russia. Remarkably, to the limited extent that Strum is known today, it is as a literary figure in a novel and not as a real person.</summary>
