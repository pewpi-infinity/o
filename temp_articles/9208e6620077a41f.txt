    <summary>  There continues to be enormous interest in the BCS to BEC transition as there still is no exact theory. We recently reported a revealing reinterpretation of the condensed phase Boson-Fermion Model (BFM) by comparing it to a cold atom formulation [1]. While the ground and singly excited states appear to remain continuous in all models we have examined, the collective modes contain a singularity due to a Feshbach resonance (tuned by doping) causing a breakdown of the Migdal theorem. As a result of vertex corrections, there is a fundamental change in the nature of the superconductivity due to the formation of preformed pairs as the previously suggested location [1] of a quantum critical point in the fulleride phase diagram is passed. The result is a quantum phase transition (QPT) between BCS and BEC-like (or Feshbach resonance) superconductivity (SC).
  We discuss features of the resonance and the role of the experimentally observed preformed pair formation in fullerides, essential to the Boson-Fermion Model (BFM), and often speculated since the work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [17]. Here, we present arguments to establish a model of the preformed pair which can be favorably compared to a circular charge density wave (CDW) isolated on a fulleride molecule. The binding is much larger than a Cooper pair. The CDW seems to be stabalized by splitting of the Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes to reduce Coulomb repulsions. Our conclusions are: 1) the doping of two electrons into triply degenerate orbitals results in the experimentally observed singlet state (CDW); and 2) this CDW (preformed pair) has a dual role as doping is varied: suppression of BCS SC and enabling a Feshbach resonance form of SC.</summary>

    <summary>  Strong repulsive interactions in a one-dimensional electron system suppress the exchange coupling J of electron spins to a value much smaller than the Fermi energy E_F. The conventional theoretical description of such systems based on the bosonization approach and the concept of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid is applicable only at energies below J. In this paper we develop a theoretical approach valid at all energies below the Fermi energy, including a broad range of energies between J and E_F. The method involves bosonization of the charge degrees of freedom, while the spin excitations are treated exactly. We use this technique to calculate the spectral functions of strongly interacting electron systems at energies in the range J&lt;&lt;epsilon&lt;&lt; E_F$. We show that in addition to the expected features at the wavevector k near the Fermi point k_F, the spectral function has a strong peak centered at k=0. Our theory also provides analytical description of the spectral function singularities near 3k_F (the "shadow band" features).</summary>

    <title>Measuring the W-Boson mass at a hadron collider: a study of phase-space singularity methods</title>

    <summary>The traditional method to measure the W-Boson mass at a hadron collider (more precisely, its ratio to the Z-mass) utilizes the distributions of three variables in events where the W decays into an electron or a muon: the charged-lepton transverse momentum, the missing transverse energy and the transverse mass of the lepton pair. We study the putative advantages of the additional measurement of a fourth variable: an improved phase-space singularity mass. This variable is statistically optimal, and simultaneously exploits the longitudinal- and transverse-momentum distributions of the charged lepton. Though the process we discuss is one of the simplest realistic ones involving just one unobservable particle, it is fairly non-trivial and constitutes a good "training" example for the scrutiny of phenomena involving invisible objects. Our graphical analysis of the phase space is akin to that of a Dalitz plot, extended to such processes.</summary>
