    <summary>Wave kinetic theory has been developed to describe the statistical dynamics of weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves. However, we show that systems which are generally dispersive can have resonant sets of wave modes with identical group velocities, leading to a local breakdown of dispersivity. This shows up as a geometric singularity of the resonant manifold and possibly as an infinite phase measure in the collision integral. Such singularities occur widely for classical wave systems, including acoustical waves, Rossby waves, helical waves in rotating fluids, light waves in nonlinear optics and also in quantum transport, e.g. kinetics of electron-hole excitations (matter waves) in graphene. These singularities are the exact analogue of the critical points found by Van Hove in 1953 for phonon dispersion relations in crystals. The importance of these singularities in wave kinetics depends on the dimension of phase space $D=(N-2)d$ ($d$ physical space dimension, $N$ the number of waves in resonance) and the degree of degeneracy $δ$ of the critical points. Following Van Hove, we show that non-degenerate singularities lead to finite phase measures for $D&gt;2$ but produce divergences when $D\leq 2$ and possible breakdown of wave kinetics if the collision integral itself becomes too large (or even infinite). Similar divergences and possible breakdown can occur for degenerate singularities, when $D-δ\leq 2,$ as we find for several physical examples, including electron-hole kinetics in graphene. When the standard kinetic equation breaks down, then one must develop a new singular wave kinetics. We discuss approaches from pioneering 1971 work of Newell \&amp; Aucoin on multi-scale perturbation theory for acoustic waves and field-theoretic methods based on exact Schwinger-Dyson integral equations for the wave dynamics.</summary>

    <title>Three Dimensional Reconfigurable Optical Singularities in Bilayer Photonic Crystals</title>

    <summary>Metasurfaces and photonic crystals have revolutionized classical and quantum manipulation of light, and opened the door to studying various optical singularities related to phases and polarization states. However, traditional nanophotonic devices lack reconfigurability, hindering the dynamic switching and optimization of optical singularities. This paper delves into the underexplored concept of tunable bilayer photonic crystals (BPhCs), which offer rich interlayer coupling effects. Utilizing silicon nitride-based BPhCs, we demonstrate tunable bidirectional and unidirectional polarization singularities, along with spatiotemporal phase singularities. Leveraging these tunable singularities, we achieve dynamic modulation of bound-state-in-continuum states, unidirectional guided resonances, and both longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum. Our work paves the way for multidimensional control over polarization and phase, inspiring new directions in ultrafast optics, optoelectronics, and quantum optics.</summary>

    <title>Loss-driven gain enhancements driven by topological singularities in non-Hermitian photonic crystals defects</title>

    <summary>We show that purely lossy defects in one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic crystals can induce transmission matrix singularities not accessible with lossless defects. These singularities in turn can enable dramatic enhancement in overall system gain not accessible through conventional means. We further show that the underlying mechanism behind the loss-induced gain enhancement is due to the resonances being located specifically at topological branch cut singularities in the reflection coefficient with nontrivial winding numbers. The resulting resonances can exhibit exceptionally high quality factors in excess of $\sim 10^4$. Our work highlights the counterintuitive role of loss in engineering singularities in the gain response in non-Hermitian systems and its connection to topological phenomena in photonic systems.</summary>
