    <summary>  One of the great successes of quantum physics is the description of the long-lived Rydberg states of atoms and ions. The Bohr model is equally applicable to donor impurity atoms in semiconductor physics, where the conduction band corresponds to the vacuum, and the loosely bound electron orbiting a singly charged core has a hydrogen-like spectrum according to the usual Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, shifted to the far-infrared due to the small effective mass and high dielectric constant. Manipulation of Rydberg states in free atoms and ions by single and multi-photon processes has been tremendously productive since the development of pulsed visible laser spectroscopy. The analogous manipulations have not been conducted for donor impurities in silicon. Here we use the FELIX pulsed free electron laser to perform time-domain measurements of the Rydberg state dynamics in phosphorus- and arsenic-doped silicon and we have obtained lifetimes consistent with frequency domain linewidths for isotopically purified silicon. This implies that the dominant decoherence mechanism for excited Rydberg states is lifetime broadening, just as for atoms in ion traps. The experiments are important because they represent the first step towards coherent control and manipulation of atomic-like quantum levels in the most common semiconductor and complement magnetic resonance experiments in the literature, which show extraordinarily long spin lattice relaxation times key to many well-known schemes for quantum computing qubits for the same impurities. Our results, taken together with the magnetic resonance data and progress in precise placement of single impurities, suggest that doped silicon, the basis for modern microelectronics, is also a model ion trap.</summary>

    <title>Superconductivity The Structure Scale of the Universe (Twenty Fourth Edition)</title>

    <summary>A numerical and dimensional correlation supported by reported literature experimental evidence (Homes, Harshmann along with Voyager, EGRET, FERMI, WMAP, Planck and other space platforms) is presented which indicates that superconductivity is congruent with Charge Conjugation, Parity Change and TimeReversal (CPT) theorem and scalable with Friedmann Lemaire Robertson Walker (FLRW) cosmology within the concept of Schwinger pair production, Maxwell's permittivity-permeability and the de Broglie hypothesis. This momentum and energy conserving (elastic) CPT resonant structural lattice reverses phase and group velocities at the nuclear dimension as dictated by the speed of light and is scalable over 15 ours of magnitude from nuclear to universe dimensions, from the universe Big Bang event to present and is consistent with nuclear (quark) weak and strong forces, electromagnetic and gravitational forces being mediated by a particle of constant mass (110.123 x electron mass or 56.3 MeV/c2) related to the Higgs mass. This isotropic homogeneous CPT structure filling the space vacuum presently defines an extremely cold dark energy condition (&lt;&lt;CMBR) that dictates an equally extremely cold baryonic dark matter. The model predicts a deceleration value consistent with flat galactic rotation curves and with observed Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space translation and rotational deceleration and is generally consistent with the notion that: An object moving through momentum space will decelerate. This deceleration concept allows Type 1A supernovae universe expansion data to be interpreted as if the local universe is slowing down with respect to the rest. The predicted 33.8 microHz universe oscillations are observed by The LISA Pathfinder and stellar core gravity waves. The entire concept focuses towards engineering a critical optical volume energy (COVE) as a possible energy source.</summary>
