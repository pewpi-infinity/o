    <summary>Critical temperature, $T_c$, and the transition width, $Δ$$T_c$, are two primary parameters of the superconducting transition. The latter parameter reflects the superconducting state disturbance originating from the thermodynamic fluctuations, atomic disorder, applied magnetic field, the presence of secondary crystalline phases, applied pressure, etc. Recently, Hirsch and Marsiglio (2020 arXiv:2012.12796) performed an analysis of the transition width in several near-room-temperature superconductors (NRTS) and reported that the reduced transition width, $Δ$$T_c$$/$$T_c$, in these materials does not follow a conventional trend of transition width broadening on applied magnetic field observed in low- and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here we present thorough mathematical analysis of the magnetoresistive data, $\it{R(T,B)}$, for the high-entropy alloy $(ScZrNb)_{0.65}$$[RhPd]_{0.35}$ and hydrogen-rich superconductors of Im-3m-$H_{3}S$, C2/m-$LaH_{10}$ and P63/mmc-$CeH_9$. We found that the reduced transition width, $Δ$$T_c$$/$$T_c$, in these materials does follow a conventional broadening trend on applied magnetic field.</summary>

    <summary>Superfunctional materials are defined as materials with specific properties being superior to the functions of engineering materials. Numerous studies introduced severe plastic deformation (SPD) as an effective process to improve the functional and mechanical properties of various metallic and non-metallic materials. Moreover, the concept of ultra-SPD - introducing shear strains over 1000 to reduce the thickness of sheared phases to levels comparable to atomic distances - was recently utilized to synthesize novel superfunctional materials. In this article, the application of ultra-SPD for controlling atomic diffusion and phase transformation and synthesizing new materials with superfunctional properties is discussed. The main properties achieved by ultra-SPD include: (i) high-temperature thermal stability in new immiscible age-hardenable aluminum alloys; (ii) room-temperature superplasticity for the first time in magnesium and aluminum alloys; (iii) high strength and high plasticity in nanograined intermetallics; (iv) low elastic modulus and high hardness in biocompatible binary and high-entropy alloys; (v) superconductivity and high strength in the Nb-Ti alloys; (vi) room-temperature hydrogen storage for the first time in magnesium alloys; and (vii) superior photocatalytic hydrogen production, oxygen production, and carbon dioxide conversion on high-entropy oxides and oxynitrides as a new family of photocatalysts.</summary>

    <summary>Low-temperature alloys are important for a wide spectrum of modern technologies ranging from liquid hydrogen, and superconductivity to quantum technology. These applications push the limit of material performance into extreme coldness, often demanding a combination of strength and toughness to address various challenges. Steel is one of the most widely used materials in cryogenic applications. With the deployment in aerospace liquid hydrogen storage and the transportation industry, aluminum and titanium alloys are also gaining increasing attention. Emerging medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) demonstrate excellent low-temperature mechanical performance with a much-expanded space of material design. A database of low-temperature metallic alloys is collected from the literature and hosted in an open repository. The workflow of data collection includes automated extraction based on machine learning and natural language processing, supplemented by manual inspection and correction, to enhance data extraction efficiency and database quality. The product datasets cover key performance parameters including yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, Charpy impact energy, as well as detailed information on materials such as their types, chemical compositions, processing and testing conditions. Data statistics are analyzed to elucidate the research and development patterns and clarify the challenges in both scientific exploration and engineering deployment.</summary>
