    <summary>Plasma photonic crystals designed in this paper are composed of gas discharge tubes to control the flow of electromagnetic waves. The band structures calculated by the finite element method are consistent with the experimental results in that two distinct attenuation peaks appear in the ranges of 1 GHz to 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz to 6 GHz. Electromagnetic parameters of the plasma are extracted by the Nicolson-Ross-Weir method and effective medium theory. The measured electron density is between 1e11 cm-3 and 1e12 cm-3, which verifies the correctness of the parameter used in the simulation, and the collision frequency is near 1.5e10 Hz. As the band structures are corroborated by the measured scattering parameters, we introduce the concept of photonic topological insulator based on the quantum Valley Hall effect into the plasma photonic crystal. A valley-dependent plasma photonic crystal with hexagonal lattice is constructed, and the phase transition of the valley K(K') occurs by breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Valley-spin locked topological edge states are generated and excited by chiral sources. The frequency of the non-bulk state can be dynamically regulated by the electron density. This concept paves the way for novel, tunable topological edge states. More interestingly, the Dirac cone is broken when the electron density increases to 3.1e12 cm-3, which distinguishes from the methods of applying a magnetic field and changing the symmetry of the point group.</summary>

    <summary>In this work, we investigate the dissociation energy of the North (N) and South (S) poles of a quantum magnetic particle, incorporated within both classical and quantum mechanical perspectives. A simple model of a harmonic oscillator is employed to estimate the dissociation energy of the N-S poles, as well as the corresponding breakdown temperature and internal pressure. The results indicate that the separation of magnetic poles occurs in two states: (a) in an ultra-hot plasma medium with extremely high temperatures, such as in the core of a hot star, and (b) at extremely high pressures, such as between internal plates in complex superlattices of layered solids. The breakdown temperature is found to be of the order of $10^7$ to $10^8$ Kelvin, which is only achievable in an ultra-hot plasma environment, known as the fifth phase of matter. Based on this model, the possibility of dissociation of bonds between N and S magnetic poles for solid superlattices under very high pressures between crystal plates is also calculated. The results suggest that the presence of isolated magnetic monopoles in superlattices of solids under ultra-high-pressure conditions is possible. Consequently, the model proposes that the conductivity of magnetic monopole carriers can be applied to the manipulation of nanomaterials for the production of advanced devices, such as new generations of superconductors, new spin devices, and magnetic-electronics, advanced materials with magnetic monopoles, as well as super-dielectrics.</summary>

    <summary>The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edge truncation under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase, quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the negative permittivity background exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge states can exist within the shrunken structure by modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be excited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges. Our results show that the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</summary>
