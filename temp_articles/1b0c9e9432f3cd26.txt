    <title>Positron potential and wavefunction in LaFeAsO</title>

    <summary>  We report calculations of the positron potential and wavefunction in LaFeAsO. These calculations show that the positron wavefunction does sample the entire unit cell although it is largest in the interstices of the La layer adjacent to As atoms. The implication is that angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR) is a viable probe of the Fermi surfaces in this material. The results also apply to positive muons, and indicate that these will be localized in the La layer adjacent to As.</summary>

    <summary>In a recent study it was suggested that the positively charged muon is capable of forming its own "atoms in molecule"s (AIM) in the muonic hydrogen-like molecules, composed of two electrons, a muon and one of the hydrogen isotopes, thus deserved to be placed in the Periodic Table [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16, 6602, 2014]. In present report, the capacity of the positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners within context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their congener hydrides and no new bonding models is required to describe the bonding of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively charged muon is similar to proton from structural and bonding viewpoint and deserved to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of the muonic molecules portraying the positively charged muon as a lighter isotope of hydrogen.</summary>

    <title>Muon-induced fission as a probe of the underlying dynamics in nuclear fission</title>

    <summary>Muon-induced fission could be utilized as a probe to study the underlying dynamics of nuclear fission. The probability of muon attachment to the light asymmetric fission fragment is sensitive to fission dynamics, such as the timescale and friction of the fission event, charge asymmetry, and possibly the shape of the fission fragments. We focus on muonic atoms that are formed with actinide nuclei. A relativistic approach is employed, solving the Dirac equation for the muonic wavefunction in the presence of a time-dependent electromagnetic field generated by the fissioning nucleus. Computations are carried out on a 3-D Cartesian lattice with no symmetry assumptions. The results show a strong dependence of the attachment probability on the fission charge asymmetry and a more modest dependence on friction.</summary>
