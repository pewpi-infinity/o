    <summary>Many fundamental issues remain for black hole thermodynamics after almost half a century of its conception. For example, what are the underlying degrees of freedom of a black hole horizon that give rise to said thermodynamical properties? Furthermore, classical black holes also harbor a spacetime singularity. Although it is often believed that quantum gravity would "cure" the singularity, as emphasized by Penrose, this viewpoint requires a deeper examination. In this review, I will examine the possibility that singularities remain in quantum gravity, the roles they may play, and the possible links between singularity and black hole thermodynamics. I will also discuss how -- inspired by Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis -- gravitational entropy for a black hole can be defined using curvature invariants, and the surprising implication that the entropy of black holes in different theories of gravity are different manifestations of spacetime curvature, i.e., their underlying microstructures could be different. Finally, I review the "Hookean law" recently established for singly rotating Myers-Perry black holes (including Kerr black holes) that connect black hole fragmentation -- a consequence of the second law of black hole thermodynamics -- with the maximum "Hookean force", as well as with the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner. This also suggests a new way to study black hole microstructures, and hints at the possibility that some black holes are beyond the Hookean regime (and thus have different microstructures). While examining the remarkable connections between black hole thermodynamics, spacetime singularities and cosmic censorship, as well as gravitational entropy, I shall point out some subtleties, provide some new thoughts, and raise some hard but fundamental questions, including whether black hole thermodynamics is really just "ordinary thermodynamics" or something quite different.</summary>

    <title>Inspecting non-perturbative contributions to the Entanglement Entropy via wavefunctions</title>

    <summary>In this paper, we would like to systematically explore the implications of non-perturbative effects on entanglement in a many body system. Instead of pursuing the usual path-integral method in a singular space, we attempt to study the wavefunctions in detail. We begin with a toy model of multiple particles whose interaction potential admits multiple minima. We study the entanglement of the true ground state after taking the tunnelling effects into account and find some simple patterns. Notably, in the case of multiple particle interactions, entanglement entropy generically decreases with increasing number of minima. The knowledge of the subsystem actually increases with the number of minima. The reduced density matrix can also be seen to have close connections with graph spectra. In a more careful study of the two-well tunnelling system, we also extract the exponentially suppressed tail contribution, the analogues of instantons. To understand the effects of multiple minima in a field theory, it inspires us to inspect wavefunctions in a toy model of bosonic field describing quasi-particles of two different condensates related by Bogoliubov transformations. We find that the area law is naturally preserved. This is probably a useful set of perspectives that promise wider applications.</summary>

    <summary>We study static spherically symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations with a repulsive singularity at the centre. We show that geodesics are extendible across the singularity, so the singularity does not lead to pathological causality properties. It is best described as an irreducible spacetime boundary. As such it must be assigned to an entropy, so that the total entropy is a sum of matter entropy and of singularity entropy. We evaluate the latter by using methods that have been developed for black hole thermodynamics, namely, Euclidean Quantum Gravity and Wald's Noether charge approach. Then, we use the maximum-entropy principle in order to show that regular solutions correspond to global maxima of the total entropy for stellar masses below the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, thus providing a thermodynamic justification to the regularity assumption employed in all stellar models. The maximum entropy principle also defines stable singular configurations for masses above the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, which we name singularity stars. We analyse their properties, and discuss the possibility that they correspond to a new type of astrophysical object that intermediates between neutron stars and black holes.</summary>
