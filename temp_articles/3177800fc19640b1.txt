    <summary>  The singlet capture rate $Λ_S$ for the semileptonic weak process $μ+p \to n+ν_μ$ has been measured in the MuCap experiment. The novel experimental technique is based on stopping muons in an active target, consisting of a time projection chamber operating with ultra-pure hydrogen. This allows the unambiguous determination of the pseudoscalar form factor $g_P$ of the charged electroweak current of the nucleon. Our first result $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m^2_μ) = 7.3 \pm 1.1 $ is consistent with accurate theoretical predictions and constitutes an important test of QCD symmetries. Additional data are being collected with the aim of a three-fold reduction of the experimental uncertainties. Building on the developed advanced techniques, the new MuSun experiment is being planned to measure the muon capture rate on the deuteron to 1.5% precision. This would provide the by far most accurate experimental information on the axial current interacting with the two-nucleon system and determine the low energy constant $L_{1A}$ relevant for solar neutrino reactions.
  Muon induced atomic and molecular processes represent challenges as well as opportunities for this science program, and their interplay with the main nuclear and weak-interaction physics aspects will be discussed.</summary>

    <summary>Measuring the rate of muon capture in hydrogen provides one of the most direct ways to study the axial current of the nucleon. The MuCap experiment uses a negative muon beam stopped in a time projection chamber operated with ultra-pure hydrogen gas. Surrounded by a decay electron detector, the lifetime of muons in hydrogen can be measured to determine the singlet capture rate Lambda_s to a final precision of 1%. The capture rate determines the nucleon's pseudoscalar form factor g_p. A first result, g_p = 7.3 +- 1.1, has been published and the final analysis of the full statistics will reduce the error by a factor of up to 3. Muon capture on the deuteron probes the weak axial current in the two-nucleon system. Within the framework of effective field theories the calculation of such two-nucleon processes involving the axial current requires the knowledge of one additional low energy constant which can be extracted from the doublet capture rate Lambda_d. The same constant then allows to model-independently calculate related processes such as solar pp-fusion or neutrino-deuteron scattering. The MuSun experiment will deduce Lambda_d to better than 1.5%. The experiment uses the MuCap detection setup with a new time projection chamber operated with deuterium at 30K and several hardware upgrades. The system is currently fully commissioned and the main physics data taking will start in 2011.</summary>
