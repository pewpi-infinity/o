    <summary>The shape of the beta decay energy distribution is sensitive to the mass of the electron neutrino. Attempts to measure the endpoint shape of tritium decay have so far seen no distortion from the zero-mass form. Here we show that a new type of electron energy spectroscopy could improve future measurements of this spectrum and therefore of the neutrino mass. We propose to detect the coherent cyclotron radiation emitted by an energetic electron in a magnetic field. For mildly relativistic electrons, like those in tritium decay, the relativistic shift of the cyclotron frequency allows us to extract the electron energy from the emitted radiation. As the technique inherently involves the measurement of a frequency in a non-destructive manner, it can, in principle, achieve a high degree of resolution and accuracy.</summary>

    <title>Sterile Neutrino Searches with MicroBooNE: Electron Neutrino Disappearance</title>

    <summary>A sterile neutrino is a well motivated minimal new physics model that leaves an imprint in neutrino oscillations. Over the last two decades, a number of hints pointing to a sterile neutrino have emerged, many of which are pointing near $m_4\sim1$ eV. Here we show how MicroBooNE data can be used to search for electron neutrino disappearance using each of their four analysis channels. We find a hint for oscillations with the highest single channel significance of $2.4σ$ (using the Feldman-Cousins approach) coming from the Wire-Cell analysis and a simplified treatment of the experimental systematics. The preferred parameters are $\sin^2(2θ_{14})=0.35^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ and $Δm^2_{41}=1.25^{+0.74}_{-0.39}$ eV$^2$. This region of parameter space is in good agreement with existing hints from source experiments, is at a similar frequency but higher mixing than indicated by reactor anti-neutrinos, and is at the edge of the region allowed by solar neutrino data. Existing unanalyzed data from MicroBooNE could increase the sensitivity to the $&gt;3σ$ level.</summary>

    <summary>  A generation of neutrino experiments have established that neutrinos mix and probably have mass. The mixing phenomenon points to processes beyond those of the Standard Model, possibly at the Grand Unification energy scale. A extensive sequence of of experiments will be required to measure precisely all the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix, culminating with the discovery and study of leptonic CP violation. As a first step, extensions of conventional pion/kaon decay beams, such as off-axis beams or low-energy super-beams, have been considered. These could yield first observations of $ν_μ\to ν_e$ transitions at the atmospheric frequency, which have not yet been observed, and a first measurement of $θ_{13}$. Experiments with much better flux control can be envisaged if the neutrinos are obtained from the decays of stored particles. One such possibility is the concept of beta beams provided by the decays of radioactive nuclei, that has been developed within the context of these studies. These would provide a pure (anti-)electron-neutrino beam of a few hundred MeV, and beautiful complementarity with a high-intensity, low-energy conventional beam, enabling experimental probes of T violation as well as CP violation. Ultimately, a definitive and complete set of measurements would offered by a Neutrino Factory based on a muon storage ring. This powerful machine offers the largest reach for CP violation, even for very small values of $θ_{13}$.</summary>
