    <summary>Chromospheric and prominence plasmas contain neutral atoms, which may change the plasma dynamics through collision with ions. Most of the atoms are neutral hydrogen, but a significant amount of neutral helium may also be present in the plasma with a particular temperature. Damping of MHD waves due to ion collision with neutral hydrogen is well studied, but the effects of neutral helium are largely unknown. We aim to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of Alfven waves in solar partially ionized plasmas. We consider three-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, where one component is electron-proton-singly ionized helium and other two components are the neutral hydrogen and neutral helium atoms. We derive the dispersion relation of linear Alfven waves in isothermal and homogeneous plasma. Then we solve the dispersion relation and derive the damping rates of Alfven waves for different plasma parameters. The presence of neutral helium significantly enhances the damping of Alfven waves compared to the damping due to neutral hydrogen at certain values of plasma temperature (10000-40000 K) and ionization. Damping rates have a peak near the ion-neutral collision frequency, but decrease for the higher part of wave spectrum. Collision of ions with neutral helium atoms can be of importance for the damping of Alfven waves in chromospheric spicules and in prominence-corona transition regions.</summary>

    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>

    <summary>The presence of neutral species in a plasma has been shown to greatly affect the properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves. For instance, the interaction between ions and neutrals through momentum transfer collisions causes the damping of Alfvén waves and alters their oscillation frequency and phase speed. When the collision frequencies are larger than the frequency of the waves, single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximations can accurately describe the effects of partial ionization, since there is a strong coupling between the various species. However, at higher frequencies, the single-fluid models are not applicable and more complex approaches are required. Here, we use a five-fluid model with three ionized and two neutral components, which takes into consideration Hall's current and Ohm's diffusion in addition to the friction due to collisions between different species. We apply our model to plasmas composed of hydrogen and helium, and allow the ionization degree to be arbitrary. By means of the analysis of the corresponding dispersion relation and numerical simulations, we study the properties of small-amplitude perturbations. We discuss the effect of momentum transfer collisions on the ion-cyclotron resonances and compare the importance of magnetic resistivity, ion-neutral and ion-ion collisions on the wave damping at various frequency ranges. Application to partially ionized plasmas of the solar atmosphere are performed.</summary>
