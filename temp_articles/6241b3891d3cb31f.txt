    <summary>We use the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) as an efficient tool to fully characterize the Abelian phase of a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid emerging as the ground state of topological color code (TCC), which is a class of stabilizer states on the honeycomb lattice. We provide the fusion rules of the quasiparticle (QP) excitations of the model by introducing single- or two-body operators on physical spins for each fusion process which justify the corresponding fusion outcome. Beside, we extract the TEE from Renyi entanglement entropy (EE) of the TCC, analytically and numerically by finite size exact diagonalization on the disk shape regions with contractible boundaries. We obtain that the EE has a local contribution, which scales linearly with the boundary length in addition to a topological term, i.e. the TEE, arising from the condensation of closed strings in the ground state. We further investigate the ground state dependence of the TEE on regions with non-contractible boundaries, i.e. by cutting the torus to half cylinders, from which we further identify multiple independent minimum entropy states (MES) of the TCC and then extract the U and S modular matrices of the system, which contain the self and mutual statistics of the anyonic QPs and fully characterize the topological phase of the TCC. Eventually, we show that, in spite of the lack of a local order parameter, TEE and other physical quantities obtained from ground state wave function such as entanglement spectrum (ES) and ground state fidelity are sensitive probes to study the robustness of a topological phase. We find that the topological order in the presence of a magnetic field persists until the vicinity of the transition point, where the TEE and fidelity drops to zero and the ES splits severely, signaling breakdown of the topological phase of the TCC.</summary>

    <title>Multi-impurity chiral Kondo model: correlation functions and anyon fusion rules</title>

    <summary>The multichannel Kondo model supports effective anyons on the partially screened impurity, as suggested by its fractional impurity entropy. It was recently demonstrated for the multi-impurity chiral Kondo model, that scattering of an electron through the impurities depends on the anyon's total fusion channel. Here we study the correlation between impurity-spins. We argue, based on a combination of conformal field theory, a perturbative limit with a large number of channels $k$, and the exactly solvable two-channel case, that the inter-impurity spin correlation probes the anyon fusion of the pair of correlated impurities. This may allow, using measurement-only topological quantum computing protocols, to braid the multichannel Kondo anyons via consecutive measurements.</summary>

    <title>Fusion basis for lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity</title>

    <summary>We introduce a new basis for the gauge-invariant Hilbert space of lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity in $(2+1)$ dimensions, the fusion basis. In doing so, we shift the focus from the original lattice (or spin-network) structure directly to that of the magnetic (curvature) and electric (torsion) excitations themselves. These excitations are classified by the irreducible representations of the Drinfel'd double of the gauge group, and can be readily "fused" together by studying the tensor product of such representations. We will also describe in detail the ribbon operators that create and measure these excitations and make the quasi-local structure of the observable algebra explicit. Since the fusion basis allows for both magnetic and electric excitations from the onset, it turns out to be a precious tool for studying the large scale structure and coarse-graining flow of lattice gauge theories and loop quantum gravity. This is in neat contrast with the widely used spin-network basis, in which it is much more complicated to account for electric excitations, i.e. for Gauß~constraint violations, emerging at larger scales. Moreover, since the fusion basis comes equipped with a hierarchical structure, it readily provides the language to design states with sophisticated multi-scale structures. Another way to employ this hierarchical structure is to encode a notion of subsystems for lattice gauge theories and $(2+1)$ gravity coupled to point particles. In a follow-up work, we will exploit this notion to provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for these theories.</summary>
