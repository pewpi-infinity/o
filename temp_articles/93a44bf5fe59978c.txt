    <summary>  The singlet capture rate $Λ_S$ for the semileptonic weak process $μ+p \to n+ν_μ$ has been measured in the MuCap experiment. The novel experimental technique is based on stopping muons in an active target, consisting of a time projection chamber operating with ultra-pure hydrogen. This allows the unambiguous determination of the pseudoscalar form factor $g_P$ of the charged electroweak current of the nucleon. Our first result $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m^2_μ) = 7.3 \pm 1.1 $ is consistent with accurate theoretical predictions and constitutes an important test of QCD symmetries. Additional data are being collected with the aim of a three-fold reduction of the experimental uncertainties. Building on the developed advanced techniques, the new MuSun experiment is being planned to measure the muon capture rate on the deuteron to 1.5% precision. This would provide the by far most accurate experimental information on the axial current interacting with the two-nucleon system and determine the low energy constant $L_{1A}$ relevant for solar neutrino reactions.
  Muon induced atomic and molecular processes represent challenges as well as opportunities for this science program, and their interplay with the main nuclear and weak-interaction physics aspects will be discussed.</summary>

    <title>Excited configurations of hydrogen in the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ perovskite lattice associated with hydrogen exchange and transport</title>

    <summary>Excited configurations of hydrogen in the oxyhydride BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ ($x=0.1-0.5$), which are considered to be involved in its hydrogen transport and exchange processes, were investigated by positive muon spin relaxation ($μ^+$SR) spectroscopy using muonium (Mu) as a pseudoisotope of hydrogen. Muons implanted into the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ perovskite lattice were mainly found in two qualitatively different metastable states. One was assigned to a highly mobile interstitial protonic state, which is commonly observed in perovskite oxides. The other was found to form an entangled two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system with the nuclear spin of an H$^-$ ion at the anion site. The structure of the (H,Mu) complex agrees well with that of a neutralized center containing two H$^-$ ions at a doubly charged oxygen vacancy, which was predicted to form in the SrTiO$_{3-δ}$ perovskite lattice by a computational study [Y. Iwazaki $et$ $al$., APL Materials 2, 012103 (2014)]. Above 100 K, interstitial Mu$^+$ diffusion and retrapping to a deep defect were observed, which could be a rate-limiting step of macroscopic Mu/H transport in the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ lattice.</summary>

    <title>Nonperturbative QCD corrections to electroweak observables</title>

    <summary>Nonperturbative QCD corrections are important to many low-energy electroweak observables, for example the muon magnetic moment. However, hadronic corrections also play a significant role at much higher energies due to their impact on the running of standard model parameters, such as the electromagnetic coupling. Currently, these hadronic contributions are accounted for by a combination of experimental measurements, effective field theory techniques and phenomenological modeling but ideally should be calculated from first principles. Recent developments indicate that many of the most important hadronic corrections may be feasibly calculated using lattice QCD methods. To illustrate this, we will examine the lattice computation of the leading-order QCD corrections to the muon magnetic moment, paying particular attention to a recently developed method but also reviewing the results from other calculations. We will then continue with several examples that demonstrate the potential impact of the new approach: the leading-order corrections to the electron and tau magnetic moments, the running of the electromagnetic coupling, and a class of the next-to-leading-order corrections for the muon magnetic moment. Along the way, we will mention applications to the Adler function, which can be used to determine the strong coupling constant, and QCD corrections to muonic-hydrogen.</summary>
