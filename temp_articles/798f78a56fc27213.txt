    <summary>Effects of graphene oxide nanomaterials addition and oxidation level on ignition delay and burning rate of ethanol droplets are experimentally investigated. Three graphene oxide samples are synthesized and characterized. Separate high-speed OH* chemiluminescence and high-speed shadowgraphy images are collected. The results suggest that increasing the loading concentration from 0 to 0.1% generally increases the ignition delay, except for ethanol doped with the highly oxidized graphene. The probability density function of the atomized baby droplet diameter, initial projected velocity, and length of the projected trajectory are similar for all tested conditions and independent of the oxidation level and loading concentration of the additives. The joint probability density function calculated for the atomization-related parameters against one another suggests that the majority of the baby droplets feature a relatively short lifetime, indicating they may potentially burn inside the flame envelope. Using droplet surface regression curves versus time, the burning rate for periods in which the atomization does not occur, and for the periods that the atomization is present are estimated. The former burning rate is shown to enhance by increasing the loading concentration and reducing the oxidation level of graphene. However, it is found that a maximum increase in the latter burning rate for both loading concentrations occurs for ethanol doped with the graphene oxide that features maximum amount of infrared radiation absorption. It is shown that relatively intense atomization suppresses the mass loss. Doping ethanol with graphene oxide and increasing the loading concentration from 0.01 to 0.1% enhances the overall burning rate, with a maximum enhancement of 8.4% pertaining to addition of reduced oxidized graphene oxide and for the loading concentration of 0.1%.</summary>

    <summary>A two-dimensional layer of oxide reveals itself as a essential element to drive the photocatalytic activity in a nanostructured hybrid material, which combines high-quality epitaxial graphene and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. In particular, it has been revealed that the addition of a 2D Ti oxide layer sandwiched between graphene and metal induces a p-doping of graphene and a consistent shift in the Ti d states. These modifications induced by the interfacial oxide layer induce a reduction of the probability of charge carrier recombination and enhance the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure. This is indicative of a capital role played by thin oxide films in fine-tuning the properties of heterostructures based on graphene and pave the way to new combinations of graphene/oxides for photocatalysis-oriented applications.</summary>

    <title>Graphene on Insulating Oxide Substrates: Role of Surface Dangling States</title>

    <summary>  We study the effect of insulating oxide substrates on the energy band structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene using a first principles density functional based electronic structure method and a local exchange correlation approximation. We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz) and Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We focus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in perturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface terminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated quartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large equilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface terminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top surface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with the Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second carbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface layers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with both surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers. By passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top layer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the Fermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important role than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the linear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms ripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found to be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.</summary>
