    <summary>Germanium (Ge) has emerged as a contender for scalable solid-state spin qubits. This interest stems from the numerous attractive properties of hole spin in Ge low-dimensional systems and their compatibility with the standards of silicon processing. Herein, we show that the controlled incorporation of Sn into the Ge lattice enables hole spin quantum dots that retain the same advantages as those made of Ge while also providing bandgap directness. The latter is essential for a more efficient interaction with light, a key feature in the implementation of photon-spin interfaces and quantum memories. We first map the material properties for a range of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ planar heterostructures to identify the optimal conditions to simultaneously achieve hole spin confinement and bandgap directness. Although compressive strain is necessary for heavy hole confinement, we estimate that an additional 4.5 at.% of Sn is needed for every 1% increase in the absolute value of compressive strain to preserve the direct bandgap. However, a high compressive strain is found to be detrimental to the Rashba coupling. Moreover, a theoretical framework is derived to evaluate the dipole moment $d$ and the relaxation rate $Γ$ of electric dipole spin resonance quantum dot devices. We compare the perturbative and effective values of $d$ with the values obtained from the full 3D Hamiltonian. We find $d$ to be around 1 and 0.01 e pm for the out-of-plane and in-plane configurations, respectively, and $Γ\propto B^5$, eventually becoming $\propto B^7$ in the out-of-plane configuration.</summary>

    <title>Magnonic Band Structure, Complete Bandgap and Collective Spin Wave Excitation in Nanoscale Two--Dimensional Magnonic Crystals</title>

    <summary>We present the observation of a complete bandgap and collective spin wave excitation in two-dimensional magnonic crystals comprised of arrays of nanoscale antidots and nanodots, respectively. Considering that the frequencies dealt with here fall in the microwave band, these findings can be used for the development of suitable magnonic metamaterials and spin wave based signal processing. We also present the application of a numerical procedure, to compute the dispersion relations of spin waves for any high symmetry direction in the first Brillouin zone. The results obtained from this procedure has been reproduced and verified by the well established plane wave method for an antidot lattice, when magnetization dynamics at antidot boundaries is pinned. The micromagnetic simulation based method can also be used to obtain iso--frequency countours of spin waves. Iso--frequency contours are analougous of the Fermi surfaces and hence, they have the potential to radicalize our understanding of spin wave dynamics. The physical origin of bands, partial and full magnonic bandgaps has been explained by plotting the spatial distribution of spin wave energy spectral density. Although, unfettered by rigid assumptions and approximations, which afflict most analytical methods used in the study of spin wave dynamics, micromagnetic simulations tend to be computationally demanding. Thus, the observation of collective spin wave excitation in the case of nanodot arrays, which can obviate the need to perform simulations may also prove to be valuable.</summary>

    <title>Longitudinal spin-relaxation of donor-bound electrons in direct bandgap semiconductors</title>

    <summary>We measure the donor-bound electron longitudinal spin-relaxation time ($T_1$) as a function of magnetic field ($B$) in three high-purity direct-bandgap semiconductors: GaAs, InP, and CdTe, observing a maximum $T_1$ of $1.4~\text{ms}$, $0.4~\text{ms}$ and $1.2~\text{ms}$, respectively. In GaAs and InP at low magnetic field, up to $\sim2~\text{T}$, the spin-relaxation mechanism is strongly density and temperature dependent and is attributed to the random precession of the electron spin in hyperfine fields caused by the lattice nuclear spins. In all three semiconductors at high magnetic field, we observe a power-law dependence ${T_1 \propto B^{-ν}}$ with ${3\lesssim ν\lesssim 4}$. Our theory predicts that the direct spin-phonon interaction is important in all three materials in this regime in contrast to quantum dot structures. In addition, the "admixture" mechanism caused by Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling combined with single-phonon processes has a comparable contribution in GaAs. We find excellent agreement between high-field theory and experiment for GaAs and CdTe with no free parameters, however a significant discrepancy exists for InP.</summary>
