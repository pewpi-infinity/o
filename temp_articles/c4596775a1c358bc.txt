    <summary>It is emphasized that the bunching parameter $β=P_B/P_D$ , i.e. the ratio between the probability to measure two bosons and two distinguishable particles at the same state, is a constant of motion and depends only on the overlap between the initial wavefunctions. This ratio is equal to $β=2/(1+I^2)$ , where $I$ is the overlap integral between the initial wavefunctions. That is, only when the initial wavefunctions are orthogonal this ratio is equal to 2, however, this bunching ratio can be reduced to 1, when the two wavefunctions are identical. This simple equation explains the experimental evidences of a beam splitter. A straightforward conclusion is that by measuring the local bunching parameter $β$ (at any point in space and time) it is possible to evaluate a global parameter$ I$ (the overlap between the initial wavefunctions). The bunching parameter is then generalized to arbitrary number of particles, and in an analogy to the two-particles scenario, the well-known bosonic enhancement appears only when all states are orthogonal.</summary>

    <summary>Recently, the use of neural quantum states for describing the ground state of many- and few-body problems has been gaining popularity because of their high expressivity and ability to handle intractably large Hilbert spaces. In particular, methods based on variational Monte Carlo have proven to be successful in describing the physics of bosonic systems such as the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model. However, this technique has not been systematically tested on the parameter space of the BH model, particularly at the boundary between the Mott insulator and superfluid phases. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of variational Monte Carlo with a trial wavefunction given by a Restricted Boltzmann Machine to reproduce the quantum ground state of the BH model on several points of its parameter space. To benchmark the technique, we compare its results to the ground state found through exact diagonalization for small one-dimensional chains. In general, we find that the learned ground state correctly estimates many observables, reproducing to a high degree the phase diagram for the first Mott lobe and part of the second one. However, we find that the technique is challenged whenever the system transitions between excitation manifolds, as the ground state is not learned correctly at these boundaries. We improve the quality of the results produced by the technique by proposing a method to discard noisy probabilities learned in the ground state.</summary>

    <title>Multi-Gauge-Boson Vertices and Chiral Lagrangian Parameters in Higgsless Models with Ideal Fermion Delocalization</title>

    <summary>  Higgsless models with fermions whose SU(2) properties are "ideally delocalized," such that the fermion's probability distribution is appropriately related to the W boson wavefunction, have been shown to minimize deviations in precision electroweak parameters. As contributions to the S parameter vanish to leading order, current constraints on these models arise from limits on deviations in multi-gauge-boson vertices. We compute the form of the triple and quartic gauge boson vertices in these models and show that these constraints provide lower bounds only of order a few hundred GeV on the masses of the lightest KK resonances. Higgsless models with ideal fermion delocalization provide an example of extended electroweak gauge interactions with suppressed couplings of fermions to extra gauge-bosons, and these are the only models for which triple-gauge-vertex measurements provide meaningful constraints. We relate the multi-gauge couplings to parameters of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian, and the parameters obtained in these SU(2) x SU(2) models apply equally to the corresponding five dimensional gauge theory models of QCD. We also discuss the collider phenomenology of the KK resonances in models with ideal delocalization. These resonances are found to be fermiophobic, therefore traditional direct collider searches are not sensitive to them and measurements of gauge-boson scattering will be needed to find them.</summary>
