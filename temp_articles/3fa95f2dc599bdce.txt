    <summary>Plasma-facing materials (PFMs) represent one of the most significant challenges for the design of future nuclear fusion reactors. Inside the reactor, the divertor will experience the harshest material environment: intense bombardment of neutrons and plasma particles coupled with large and intermittent heat fluxes. The material designated to cover this role in ITER is tungsten (W). While no other materials have shown the potential to match the properties of W, many drawbacks associated with its application remain, including: cracking and erosion induced by a low recrystallization temperature combined with a high ductile-brittle transition temperature and neutron-initiated embrittlement; surface morphology changes (fuzz layer) due to plasma-W interaction with subsequent risk of spontaneous material melting and delamination; low oxidation resistance. This work aims to produce a structured and comprehensive materials screening of PFMs candidates based on known inorganic materials. The methodology applied in this study to identify the most promising PFM candidates combines peer-reviewed data present in the Pauling File database and DFT calculations of two key PFMs defects, namely the surface binding energy and the formation energy of a hydrogen interstitial. The crystal structures and their related properties, extracted from the Pauling File, are ranked according to the heat-balance equation of a PFM subject to the heat loads in the divertor region of an ITER-like tokamak. The materials satisfying the requirements are critically compared with the state-of-the-art literature, defining an optimal subset where to perform the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The majority of previously known PFMs are captured by this screening process, confirming its reliability. Additionally, less familiar refractory materials suggest performance that calls for further investigations.</summary>

    <title>Radiation Damage and Thermal Recovery of Perovskite Superconductor Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide</title>

    <summary>High temperature superconducting materials are being considered to generate the magnetic fields required for the confinement of plasma in fusion reactors. The present study aims to assess the microstructural degradation resulting from ion implantation at room temperature under two implantation conditions in Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) tapes. Xray Diffraction (XRD) and high resolution characterisation techniques including Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses were used to correlate alterations in superconducting behaviour measured using a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) to amorphization and recovery caused by ion implantation. TEM analysis was performed to depth profile the degree of crystallinity (or lack thereof) on irradiated samples. SRIM predicted the damage depth at 900 nm below the sample surface of the 2 MeV Xe implanted sample and 450 nm beneath the surface of the 0.6 MeV Xe implanted sample. 2 MeV Xe implantation caused the superconducting temperature to decrease by 10 K and the critical current density to display a 10 fold reduction. Post irradiation heat treatments up to 600C caused recrystallisation of the irradiated layer, but also oxygen loss and alterations in grain size. The recrystallised grain orientation was random in TEM lamellae, however, bulk samples re-grew along the original crystal orientation provided that some of the original material was not amorphized (ie if they nucleated on crystalline YBCO). This is extremely promising for the thermal recovery of tokamak components.</summary>

    <title>Chemical segregation in Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films during in-situ heating</title>

    <summary>Germanium antimony telluride has been the most used and studied phase-change material for electronic memory due to its suitable crystallization temperature, amorphous to crystalline resistance contrast, and stability of the amorphous phase. In this work, the segregation of Ge in a Ge2Sb2Te5 film of 30 nm thickness during heating inside the transmission electron microscope was observed and characterized. The Ge2Sb2Te5 film was deposited using sputtering on a Protochips Fusion holder and left uncapped in atmosphere for about four months. Oxygen incorporated within the film played a significant role in the chemical segregation observed which resulted in amorphous Ge-O grain boundaries and Sb and Te rich crystalline domains. Such composition changes can occur when the phase-change material interfaces insulating oxide layers in an integrated device and would significantly impact its electrical and thermal properties.</summary>
