    <summary>The absorption energy of atomic hydrogen at rotated graphene bilayers is studied using ab initio methods based on the density functional theory including van der Waals interactions. We find that, due to the surface corrugation induced by the underneath rotated layer and the perturbation of the electronic density of states near the Fermi energy, the atoms with an almost AA stacking are the preferential ones for hydrogen chemisorption. The adsorption energy difference between different atoms can be as large as 80 meV. In addition, we find that, due to the logarithmic van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states at energies close to the Dirac point, the adsorption energy of either electron or hole doped samples is substantially increased. We also find that the adsorption energy increases with the decrease of the rotated angle between the layers. Finally, the large zero point energy of the C-H bond (${\sim 0.3 eV}$) suggests adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen and deuterium should behave differently.</summary>

    <title>Measuring the Berry phase of graphene from wavefront dislocations in Friedel oscillations</title>

    <summary>Electronic band structures dictate the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of crystalline solids. Their experimental determination is therefore of crucial importance for technological applications. While the spectral distribution in energy bands is routinely measured by various techniques, it is more difficult to access the topological properties of band structures such as the Berry phase γ. It is usually thought that measuring the Berry phase requires applying external electromagnetic forces because these allow realizing the adiabatic transport on closed trajectories along which quantum mechanical wave-functions pick up the Berry phase. In graphene, the anomalous quantum Hall effect results from the Berry phase γ = π picked up by massless relativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits and proves the existence of Dirac cones. Contradicting this belief, we demonstrate that the Berry phase of graphene can be measured in absence of any external magnetic field. We observe edge dislocations in the Friedel oscillations formed at hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry in describing these topological defects as phase singularities of complex fields, we show that the number of additional wave-fronts in the dislocation is a real space measurement of the pseudo spin winding, i.e. graphene's Berry phase. Since the electronic dispersion can also be retrieved from Friedel oscillations, our study establishes the electronic density as a powerful observable to determine both the dispersion relation and topological properties of wavefunctions. This could have profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology of relativistic and gapped phases in solids.</summary>

    <title>Surface Van Hove Singularity Enabled Efficient Catalysis: The Cases of CO Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>

    <summary>Surface Van Hove singularity (SVHS), defined as the surface states near the Fermi level (EF) in low-dimensional systems, triggers exciting physical phenomena distinct from bulk. We herein explore theoretically the potential role of SVHS in catalysis taking CO oxidation reaction as prototype over graphene/Ca2N (Gra/Ca2N) heterojunction and Pt2HgSe3 (001) surface. It is demonstrated that both systems with SVHS could serve as an electron bath to promote O2 adsorption and subsequent CO oxidation with low energy barriers of 0.2 ~ 0.6 eV for Gra/Ca2N and Pt2HgSe3 (001) surface. Importantly, the catalytically active sites associated with SVHS are well-defined and uniformly distributed over the whole surface plane, which is superior to the commonly adopted defect or doping strategy, and further the chemical reactivity of SVHS also can be tuned easily via adjusting its position with respect to EF. Our study demonstrates the enabling power of SVHS, and provides novel physical insights into the promising potential role of VHS in designing high-efficiency catalysts.</summary>
