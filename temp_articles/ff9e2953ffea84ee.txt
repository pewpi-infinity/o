    <summary>  We investigate the total entropy production of a Brownian particle in a driven bistable system. This system exhibits the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. We show that in the time-periodic steady state, the probability density function for the total entropy production satisfies Seifert's integral and detailed fluctuation theorems over finite time trajectories.</summary>

    <title>Stochastic Resonance for a Model with Two Pathways</title>

    <summary>In this thesis we consider stochastic resonance for a diffusion with drift given by a potential, which has two metastable states and two pathways between them. Depending on the direction of the forcing the height of the two barriers, one for each path, will either oscillate alternating or in synchronisation.
  We consider a simplified model given by discrete and continuous time Markov Chains with two states. This was done for alternating and synchronised wells. The invariant measures are derived for both cases and shown to be constant for the synchronised case. A PDF for the escape time from an oscillatory potential is reviewed.
  Methods of detecting stochastic resonance are presented, which are linear response, signal-to-noise ratio, energy, out-of-phase measures, relative entropy and entropy. A new statistical test called the conditional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is developed, which can be used to analyse stochastic resonance.
  An explicit two dimensional potential is introduced, the critical point structure derived and the dynamics, the invariant state and escape time studied numerically.
  The six measures are unable to detect the stochastic resonance in the case of synchronised saddles. The distribution of escape times however not only shows a clear sign of stochastic resonance, but changing the direction of the forcing from alternating to synchronised saddles an additional resonance at double the forcing frequency starts to appear. The conditional KS test reliably detects the stochastic resonance even for forcing quick enough and for data so sparse that the stochastic resonance is not obvious directly from the histogram of escape times.</summary>

    <title>Resonant behavior and unpredictability in forced chaotic scattering</title>

    <summary>Chaotic scattering in open Hamiltonian systems is a topic of fundamental interest in physics, which has been mainly studied in the purely conservative case. However, the effect of weak perturbations in this kind of systems has been an important focus of interest in the last decade. In a previous work, the authors studied the effects of a periodic forcing in the decay law of the survival probability, and they characterized the global properties of escape dynamics. In the present paper, we add two important issues in the effects of periodic forcing: the fractal dimension of the set of singularities in the scattering function, and the unpredictability of the exit basins, which is estimated by using the concept of basin entropy. Both the fractal dimension and the basin entropy exhibit a resonant-like decrease as the forcing frequency increases. We provide a theoretical reasoning, which could justify this decreasing in the fractality near the main resonant frequency, that appears for $ω\approx 1$. We attribute the decrease in the basin entropy to the reduction of the area occupied by the KAM islands and the basin boundaries when the frequency is close to the resonance. Finally, the decay rate of the exponential decay law shows a minimum value of the amplitude, $A_c$, which reflects the complete destruction of the KAM islands in the resonance. We expect that this work could be potentially useful in research fields related to chaotic Hamiltonian pumps, oscillations in chemical reactions and companion galaxies, among others.</summary>
