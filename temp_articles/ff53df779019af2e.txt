    <summary>A Fano-like phonon resonance is observed in few-layer (~3) graphene at room temperature using infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. This Fano resonance is the manifestation of a strong electron-phonon interaction between the discrete in-plane lattice vibrational mode and continuum electronic excitations in graphene. By employing ammonia chemical doping, we have obtained different Fano line shapes ranging from anti-resonance in hole-doped graphene to phonon-dominated in n-type graphene. The Fano resonance shows the strongest interference feature when the Fermi level is located near the Dirac point. The charged phonon exhibits much-enhanced oscillator strength and experiences a continuous red shift in frequency as electron density increases. It is suggested that the phonon couples to different electronic transitions as Fermi level is tuned by chemical doping.</summary>

    <title>Double resonance Raman study of disorder in CVD-grown single-walled carbon nanotubes</title>

    <summary>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with varying degrees of disorder were investigated using multiple-excitation Raman spectroscopy. The lattice disorder was imparted into the nanotubes by the addition of varying amounts of sulfur to the iron catalyst in a thermal chemical vapor deposition process. Changes in the intensities of peaks occurring due to a double resonance Raman process were studied. The intensity of the disorder-induced D band increased with a decrease in the sulfur content. Upon post-synthesis heat treatment, the double resonance process got quenched due to defect healing. The second order G' band and iTOLA bands exhibited a two-peak structure, of which one of the peaks is relatively more sensitive to defects and decreased in intensity with heat treatment.</summary>

    <title>Piezoelectric Polar Nano Regions and Relaxation-Coupled Resonances in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
    <updated>2018-01-08T19:36:30Z</updated>

    <summary>\indent It is a generally accepted fact that the unique dielectric properties of relaxor ferroelectrics are related to the formation of polar nanoregion (PNRs). Less well recognized is the corollary that, because they are polar and therefore lack inversion symmetry, PNRs are also piezoelectric at the nanoscale and can therefore behave as nanoresonators. Using the particular relaxor ferroelectric K$_{\tt1-x}$Li$_{\tt x}$TaO$_{\tt 3}$ (KLT), we show that, when electrically excited into oscillation, these piezoelectric nanoresonators can drive macroscopic electro-mechanical resonances. Unexpectedly however, pairs of coupled resonances are observed, with one of the two exhibiting a characteristic Fano-like lineshape. The complex resonance spectra can be described equally well by two alternative but complementary models both involving two resonances coupled through a relaxation: a purely classical one based on two coupled damped harmonic oscillators and a semi-classical based on two discrete excitations coupled to each other through a continuum. Together, they provide complementary perspectives on the underlying physics of the system. Both reproduce the rapid evolution of the resonance spectrum across three wide temperature ranges, including a phase transition range. In the high temperature range, the coupling between modes is due to the collective $π$ relaxation of the lithium ions within PNRs and in the phase transition range to "heterophase relaxation" of the surrounding lattice between its high temperature cubic and low temperature tetragonal phases. The coupling is suppressed in the intermediate range of the collective $π/2$ relaxation of the lithium ions. Incidentally, the measured dielectric spectra are shown to bear a surprising but justifiable resemblance to the optical spectra of certain atomic vapors that exhibit electromagnetically induced transparency.</summary>
