    <summary>The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial-state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.</summary>

    <summary>It is shown that the ground state or vacuum to the lattice Euclidean quantum gravity is significantly different from the ground states to the well-known vacua in QED, QCD, et cetera. In the case of the lattice Euclidean quantum gravity, the long-wavelength scale vacuum structure is similar to that in QED, moreover the quantum fluctuations to gravity are very reduced in comparison with the situation in QED. But the small scale (of the order of the lattice scale) vacuum structure to gravity is significantly different from that to the long-wavelength scales: the fluctuation values of geometrical degrees of freedom (tetrads) are commensurable with theirs most probable values.</summary>

    <summary>One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</summary>
