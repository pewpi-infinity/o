    <summary>The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.</summary>

    <summary>A fast optical spectroscopic method for determination rotational ($T_{rot}$) and vibrational ($T_{vib}$) temperatures in two-temperature Boltzmann distribution of the excited state by using machine learning approach is presented. The method is applied to estimate molecular gas temperatures in a direct current glow discharge in hydrogen-methane gas mixture during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of carbon film materials. Slightly resolved ro-vibrational optical emission spectrum of the $C_2$ ($ν'=0 \to ν''=0$) Swan band system was used for local temperature measurements in plasma ball. Random Forest algorithm of machine learning was explored for determination of temperature distribution maps. In addition to the $T_{rot}$ , $T_{vib}$ maps, distribution maps and their gradients for electron temperature ($T_e$) and for the emission intensity of the spectral line 516,5$nm$ corresponding to $C_2$ species is presented and is discussed in detail.</summary>

    <title>Temperature Dependent Functions of the Electron Neutral Momentum Transfer Collision Cross Sections of Selected Combustion Plasma Species</title>
    <updated>2023-10-16T17:13:14Z</updated>

    <summary>The collision cross sections (CCS), momentum transfer cross sections (MTCS), or scattering cross sections (SCS) of an electron neutral pair are important components for computing the electric conductivity of a plasma gas. Larger collision cross sections for electrons moving freely within neutral particles (molecules or atoms) cause more scattering of these electrons by the neutral particles, which leads to degraded electron mobility, and thus reduced electric conductivity of the plasma gas that consists of electrons, neutral particles, and ions. The present work aimed to identify the level of disagreement between four different methods for describing how electron neutral collision cross sections vary when they are treated as a function of electron temperature alone. These four methods are based on data or models previously reported in the literature. The analysis covered six selected gaseous species that are relevant to combustion plasma, which are as follows: carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), molecular hydrogen (H2), water vapor (H2O), potassium vapor (K), and molecular oxygen (O2). The temperature dependence of the collision cross sections for these species was investigated in the range from 2000 K to 3000 K, which is suitable for both conventional air fuel combustion and elevated temperature oxygen fuel (oxy-fuel) combustion. The findings of the present study suggest that linear functions are enough to describe the variations in the collision cross sections of the considered species in the temperature range of interest for combustion plasma. Also, the values of the coefficient of variation (defined as the sample standard deviation divided by the mean) in the collision cross sections using the four methods were approximately 27% for CO, 42% for CO2, 13% for H2, 39% for H2O, 44% for K, and 19% for O2.</summary>
