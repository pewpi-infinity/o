    <summary>  Quantum algebras (also called quantum groups) are deformed versions of the usual Lie algebras, to which they reduce when the deformation parameter q is set equal to unity. From the mathematical point of view they are Hopf algebras. Their use in physics became popular with the introduction of the q-deformed harmonic oscillator as a tool for providing a boson realization of the quantum algebra SUq(2), although similar mathematical structures had already been known. Initially used for solving the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, quantum algebras have subsequently found applications in several branches of physics, as, for example, in the description of spin chains, squeezed states, hydrogen atom and hydrogen-like spectra, rotational and vibrational nuclear and molecular spectra, and in conformal field theories. By now much work has been done on the q-deformed oscillator and its relativistic extensions, and several kinds of generalized deformed oscillators and SU(2) algebras have been introduced. Here we shall confine ourselves to a list of applications of quantum algebras in nuclear structure physics and in molecular physics and, in addition, a recent application of quantum algebraic techniques to the structure of atomic clusters will be discussed in more detail.</summary>

    <summary>Constraint on spin-dependent and spin-independent Yukawa potential at atomic scale is developed. That covers constraints on a coupling constant of an additional photon $γ^*$ and a pseudovector boson. The mass range considered is from $1\;{\rm eV}/c^2$ to $1\;{\rm MeV}/c^2$. The strongest constraint on a coupling constant $α^\prime$ is at the level of a few parts in $10^{13}$ (for $γ^*$) and below one part in $10^{16}$ (for a pseudovector) corresponding to mass below $1\;{\rm keV}/c^2$. The constraints are derived from low-energy tests of quantum electrodynamics and are based on spectroscopic data on light hydrogen-like atoms and experiments with magnetic moments of leptons and light nuclei.</summary>

    <summary>  A simple mapping procedure is presented by which classical orbits and path integrals for the motion of a point particle in flat space can be transformed directly into those in curved space with torsion. Our procedure evolved from well-established methods in the theory of plastic deformations, where crystals with defects are described mathematically as images of ideal crystals under active nonholonomic coordinate transformations.
  Our mapping procedure may be viewed as a natural extension of Einstein's famous equivalence principle. When applied to time-sliced path integrals, it gives rise to a new "quantum equivalence principle" which determines short-time action and measure of fluctuating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations possesses a nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which produces in a curved space an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar R, thus canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt. This cancelation is important for correctly describing semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensable for the process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed by those fields.</summary>
