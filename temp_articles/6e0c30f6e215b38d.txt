    <summary>  Schrodinger's equation predicts something very peculiar about the electron in the Hydrogen atom: its total energy must be equal to zero. Unfortunately, an analysis of a zero-energy wavefunction for the electron in the Hydrogen atom has not been attempted in the published literature. This paper provides such an analysis for the first time and uncovers a few interesting facts, including the fact that a "zero-energy wavefunction" is actually a quantized version of the classical wavefunction that has been known for decades.</summary>

    <title>The novel aspect of hydrogen atom: the fine structure and spin can be derived by single component wavefunction</title>

    <summary>  The fine structure of hydrogen energy was calculated by using the usual momentum-wavefunction relation directly, rather than establishing the well-known Dirac wave equation. As the results, the energy levels are completely the same as that of the Dirac wave equation, while the wavefunction is single component that is quite different from Dirac's four component wavefunction, the most important thing is that the present calculation brings out electronic spin in a new way which has never been reported and indicates that the electronic spin is a kind of orbital motion.</summary>

    <title>Backflow Correlations for the Electron Gas and Metallic Hydrogen</title>

    <summary>  We justify and evaluate backflow-threebody wavefunctions for a two component system of electrons and protons. Based on the generalized Feynman-Kacs formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band structure calculations, we analyze the use and the analytical form of the backflow function from different points of view. The resulting wavefunctions are used in Variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-threebody wavefunctions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using LDA orbitals in the trial wavefunction. However, compared to wavefunctions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wavefunctions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.</summary>
