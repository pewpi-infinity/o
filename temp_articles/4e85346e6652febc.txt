    <summary>  The sample dependence of various properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon ($a$-Si:H) have been studied with 216 silicon atoms and 24 hydrogen atoms using the density functional based tight binding molecular dynamics simulations. The Si-Si and Si-H pair correlation functions are independent of preparation procedure as well as initial conditions, the H-H pair correlation functions are sample dependent. The distribution of hydrogen atoms in all the samples is nonuniform and depends upon the preparation procedure as well as the initial structure from which the hydrogenated amorphous silicon sample is generated. The Si-Si bond length and Si-Si-Si bond angle distributions are nearly independent of sample preparation procedure, but Si-H bond length distributions are sample dependent. The peaks in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) at high frequencies are in reasonable accord with the experimental results. The positions of the high frequency peaks are found to be dependent on the local environment. While the high frequency vibrational modes related to Si-Si bond vibrations are moderately localized, the vibrational modes related to Si-H bond vibrations in $a$-Si:H samples are highly localized. In samples generated from the liquid quench the free energy is smaller, whereas the entropy and specific heat are larger as compared to that of samples generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples. The total electronic density of states and local density of electronic states (LDOS) at Si atom sites are nearly sample independent, while the LDOS at the H atom sites are dependent on the sample preparation procedure.</summary>

    <summary>  The recombination history of the Universe depends exponentially on the temperature, T_0, of the cosmic microwave background. Therefore tiny changes of T_0 are expected to lead to significant changes in the free electron fraction. Here we show that even the current 1sigma-uncertainty in the value of T_0 results in more than half a percent ambiguity in the ionization history, and more than 0.1% uncertainty in the TT and EE power spectra at small angular scales. We discuss how the value of T_0 affects the highly redshifted cosmological hydrogen recombination spectrum and demonstrate that T_0 could, in principle, be measured by looking at the low frequency distortions of the cosmic microwave background spectrum. For this no absolute measurements are necessary, but sensitivities on the level of ~30nK are required to extract the quasi-periodic frequency-dependent signal with typical Delta nu/nu~0.1 coming from cosmological recombination. We also briefly mention the possibility of obtaining additional information on the specific entropy of the Universe, and other cosmological parameters.</summary>

    <summary>We present all {\bf A}mons for {\bf G}DB and {\bf Z}inc data-bases using no more than 7 non-hydrogen atoms (AGZ7)---a calculated organic chemistry building-block dictionary based on the AMON approach [Huang and von Lilienfeld, {\em Nature Chemistry} (2020)]. AGZ7 records Cartesian coordinates of compositional and constitutional isomers, as well as properties for $\sim$140k small organic molecules obtained by systematically fragmenting all molecules of Zinc and the majority of GDB17 into smaller entities, saturating with hydrogens, and containing no more than 7 heavy atoms (excluding hydrogen atoms). AGZ7 cover the elements \{H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, Sn and I\} and includes optimized geometries, total energy and its decomposition, Mulliken atomic charges, dipole moment vectors, quadrupole tensors, electronic spatial extent, eigenvalues of all occupied orbitals, LUMO, gap, isotropic polarizability, harmonic frequencies, reduced masses, force constants, IR intensity, normal coordinates, rotational constants, zero-point energy, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, free energy, and heat capacity (all at ambient conditions) using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ (pseudopotentials were used for Sn and I) level of theory. We exemplify the usefulness of this data set with AMON based machine learning models of total potential energy predictions of seven of the most rigid GDB-17 molecules.</summary>
