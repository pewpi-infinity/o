    <summary>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</summary>

    <title>Muon Capture Constraints on Sterile Neutrino Properties</title>

    <summary>We show that ordinary and radiative muon capture impose stringent constraints on sterile neutrino properties. In particular, we consider a sterile neutrino with a mass between 40 to $80 {\rm MeV}$ that has a large mixing with the muon neutrino and decays predominantly into a photon and light neutrinos due to a large transition magnetic moment. Such a model was suggested as a possible resolution to the puzzle presented by the results of the LSND, KARMEN, and MiniBooNE experiments. We find that the scenario with the radiative decay to massless neutrinos is ruled out by measurements of the radiative muon capture rates at TRIUMF in the relevant mass range by a factor of a few in the squared mixing angle. These constraints are complementary to those imposed by the process of electromagnetic upscattering and de-excitation of beam neutrinos inside the neutrino detectors induced by a large transition magnetic moment. The latter provide stringent constraints on the size of the transitional magnetic moment between muon, electron neutrinos and $N$. We also show that further extension of the model with another massive neutrino in the final state of the radiative decay may be used to bypass the constraints derived in this work.</summary>

    <title>A Monochromatic Neutrino Beam for U(e3) and CP-Phase</title>

    <summary>  The goal for future neutrino facilities is the determination of the $[U_{e3}]$ mixing and CP violation in neutrino oscillations. This will require precision experiments with a very intense neutrino source. Here a novel method to create a monochromatic neutrino beam based on the recent discovery of nuclei that decay fast through electron capture is discussed. The boost of such radioactive ions will generate a monochromatic directional neutrino beam when decaying at high energy in a storage ring with long straight sections. We show that the capacity of such a facility to discover new physics is impressive, so that the principle of energy dependence in the oscillation probability of the $ν_e \to ν_μ$ channel is operational to separate out the two parameters of the mixing $θ_{13}$ and of the CP-violating phase $δ$.</summary>
