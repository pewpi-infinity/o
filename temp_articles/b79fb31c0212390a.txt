    <summary>High-entropy oxides (HEOs), containing at least five principal cations, have recently emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Despite their high potential, the impact of the cation mixtures on photocatalytic activity remains poorly understood. This study investigates the high-entropy photocatalyst TiZrHfNbTaO11 using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods to elucidate the effects of various elements on electronic structure and water splitting performance. The results indicate that the HEO exhibits a bandgap comparable to TiO2 polymorphs rutile, brookite and anatase. Cations with lower electronegativity, such as hafnium and zirconium, provide the strongest water adsorption energy, serving as active sites for water adsorption. Additionally, the co-presence of highly electronegative cations like niobium and tantalum adjacent to hafnium and zirconium enhances charge transfer to water molecules, improving splitting efficiency. These findings suggest novel strategies for designing high-entropy photocatalysts by synergistic incorporating cations with different electronegativities.</summary>

    <title>Photoreforming of plastic waste into valuable products and hydrogen using a high-entropy oxynitride with distorted atomic-scale structure</title>

    <summary>The persistent existence of plastic waste causes serious problems for the environment, directly and indirectly affecting the health of organisms and humans. Photoreforming is a nature-friendly method that only uses solar energy to convert plastic waste into green hydrogen (H2) and valuable organic products. This study shows that a high-entropy oxynitride (HEON) photocatalyst, synthesized by the addition of nitrogen to a Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-containing high-entropy oxide (HEO), exhibits a higher potential for the production of H2, formic acid and acetic acid from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) photoreforming compared to the relevant HEO. Examination of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) by synchrotron light shows that, in addition to hybridization of 2p orbitals from oxygen and nitrogen, nitrogen atoms distort the structure and completely change the neighborhood of niobium and titanium (a main contributor to the conduction band), expands the atomic bonds of zirconium and tantalum, contracts the atomic bonds of hafnium and decreases the binding energy of titanium, niobium and tantalum. These electronic structure changes lead to a narrower bandgap and diminished electron-hole recombination, enhancing the photoreforming performance. This study introduces HEONs with distorted atomic bond structures as efficient low-bandgap and stable catalysts for transforming plastics into high-value organic chemicals and H2 by photocatalysis.</summary>

    <title>High-entropy perovskites as new photocatalysts for cocatalyst-free water splitting</title>

    <summary>The photocatalytic water-splitting process is thermodynamically challenging and requires catalysts with suitable band structures, as well as the presence of supporting cocatalysts. By considering the unique charge carrier mobility in perovskites, this study introduces three new ABO3-type high-entropy perovskites (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Hf1/3)O3, (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ga1/3In1/3Sn1/3)O3 and (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Sn1/3)O3 for cocatalyst-free photocatalysis. The three catalysts, having a single-phase cubic structure, are designed by considering configurational entropy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, ionic radius deviation and valence deviation of &gt;1.5R (R: gas constant), 0.9-1.0, 0.4-0.8, &gt;0.3 and &gt;0.3, respectively. The perovskites exhibit similar valence band tops, while their bandgaps vary slightly depending on the composition at the B-site (slightly lower bandgap by including d10 cations). Additionally, all three materials demonstrate effective hydrogen generation without the need for added cocatalysts. This investigation confirms that high-entropy oxide perovskites can offer significant potential for cocatalyst-free photocatalytic reactions.</summary>
