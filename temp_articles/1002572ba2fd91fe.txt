    <summary>The storage of hydrogen (H$_2$) is of economic and ecological relevance, because it could potentially replace petroleum-based fuels. However, H$_2$ storage at mild condition remains one of the bottlenecks for its widespread usage. In order to devise successful H$_2$ storage strategies, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of the weak and elusive hydrogen interactions at the quantum mechanical level. One of the most promising strategies for storage at mild pressure and temperature is physisorption. Porous materials are specially effective at physisorption, however the process at the quantum level has been under-studied. Here, we present quantum calculations to study the interaction of H$_2$ with building units of porous materials. We report 240 H$_2$ complexes made of different transition metal (Tm) atoms, chelating ligands, spins, oxidation states, and geometrical configurations. We found that both the dispersion and electrostatics interactions are the major contributors to the interaction energy between H$_2$ and the transition metal complexes. The binding energy for some of these complexes is in the range of at least 10 kJ/mol for many interactions sites, which is one of these main requirements for practical H$_2$ storage. Thus, these results are of fundamental nature for practical H$_2$ storage in porous materials.</summary>

    <title>Classical dynamics and semiclassical analysis of excitons in cuprous oxide</title>

    <summary>Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to excitons in cuprous oxide.</summary>

    <title>Graphene intercalation of the large gap quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene</title>

    <summary>The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two-third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here, we successfully overcome this barrier, intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene. As we demonstrate through scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. We identify hydrogen as the critical component that was missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. Our findings facilitate ex-situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next-generation technologies.</summary>
