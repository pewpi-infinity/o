**The electronic structure of cuprates from high energy spectroscopy**
We report studies of the electronic structure and elementary excitations of doped and undoped cuprate chains, ladders and planes. Using high energy spectroscopies such as x-ray absorption, core level photoemission and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, important information regarding the charge distribution and hole dynamics can be obtained. The comparison of the experimental data with suitable theoretical models sets constraints on the parameters entering into the model calculations, and offers insight into the important physical quantities governing the electronic structure of these materials. Recurring themes include the importance of the dimensionality of the Cu-O network (1D-&gt;2D) and the crucial role played by the spin-background in determining the dynamics of low-lying excitations in these strongly correlated systems.

**Impact of the Ce $4f$ states in the electronic structure of the intermediate-valence superconductor CeIr$_3$**
The electronic structure of the $f$-based superconductor $\mathrm{CeIr_3}$ was studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. The energy distribution of the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states were revealed by the $\mathrm{Ce}~3d-4f$ resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states were mostly distributed in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, suggesting the itinerant character of the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states. The contribution of the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states to the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy was estimated to be nearly half of that of the $\mathrm{Ir}~5d$ states, implying that the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states have a considerable contribution to the DOS at the Fermi energy. The $\mathrm{Ce}~3d$ core-level and $\mathrm{Ce}~3d$ X-ray absorption spectra were analyzed based on a single-impurity Anderson model. The number of the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states in the ground state was estimated to be $0.8-0.9$, which is much larger than the values obtained in the previous studies (i.e., $0-0.4$).

**Surface effects on the electronic energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface**
Surface effects on the electronic energy loss of charged particles entering a metal surface are investigated within linear-response theory, in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory. Interesting phenomena occur in the loss spectra originated by the boundary (bregenzung) effect, which is as a consequence of the orthogonality of surface and bulk excitation modes. Our calculations indicate that the presence of a non-abrupt electron-density profile at the surface severely affects the nature of surface excitations, as deduced from comparison with simplified models.
