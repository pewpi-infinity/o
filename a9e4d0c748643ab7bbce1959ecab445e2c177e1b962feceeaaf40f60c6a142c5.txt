## Executive Summary
Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm). At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter. This definition of nanotechnology includes all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties. It is common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to research and applications whose common trait is scale. An earlier understanding of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabricating macroscale products, now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.

## Main Scientific Findings
### arXiv Papers
**DNA Nanotechnology Meets Nanophotonics**
In the past decades, DNA has been intensely studied and exploited in different research areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. At first glance, DNA-based nanophotonics seems to deviate quite far from the original goal of Nadrian Seeman, the founder of DNA nanotechnology, who hoped to organize biological entities using DNA in high-resolution crystals. As a matter of fact, DNA-based nanophotonics does closely follow his central spirit. That is, apart from being a genetic material for inheritance, DNA is also an ideal material for building molecular devices.

**The Nanotechnology R(evolution)**
Nanotechnology as a social concept and investment focal point has drawn much attention. Here we consider the place of nanotechnology in the second great technological revolution of mankind that began some 200 years ago. The so-called nanotechnology revolution represents both a continuation of prior science and technology trends and a re-awakening to the benefits of significant investment in fundamental research. We consider the role the military might play in the development of nanotechnology innovations, nanotechnology's context in the history of technology, and the global competition to lead the next technological revolution.

**Graphene Nanotechnology for the Next Generation Nonvolatile Memory**
As conventional silicon technology is approaching its fundamental material and physical limits with continuous scaling, there is a growing push to look for new platform to design memory circuits for nanoelectronic applications. In this paper we explore new design concept of nonvolatile memory based on graphene nanotechnology. The investigation focuses on two forms of graphene based field effect transistor (FET) carbon nanotube FET (CNTFET) and graphene nanoribbon FET (GNRFET). The analysis reveals that GNRFET with a high trapping capable oxide layer is suitable for ultra high ensity nonvolatile memory.
