**Probing magnetic ordering in air stable iron-rich van der Waals minerals**
In the rapidly expanding field of two-dimensional materials, magnetic monolayers show great promise for the future applications in nanoelectronics, data storage, and sensing. The research in intrinsically magnetic two-dimensional materials mainly focuses on synthetic iodide and telluride based compounds, which inherently suffer from the lack of ambient stability. So far, naturally occurring layered magnetic materials have been vastly overlooked. These minerals offer a unique opportunity to explore air-stable complex layered systems with high concentration of local moment bearing ions. We demonstrate magnetic ordering in iron-rich two-dimensional phyllosilicates, focusing on mineral species of minnesotaite, annite, and biotite. These are naturally occurring van der Waals magnetic materials which integrate local moment baring ions of iron via magnesium/aluminium substitution in their octahedral sites. Due to self-inherent capping by silicate/aluminate tetrahedral groups, ultra-thin layers are air-stable. Chemical characterization, quantitative elemental analysis, and iron oxidation states were determined via Raman spectroscopy, wavelength disperse X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry measurements were performed to examine the magnetic ordering. These layered materials exhibit paramagnetic or superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature. At low temperature ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering occurs, with the critical ordering temperature of 38.7 K for minnesotaite, 36.1 K for annite, and 4.9 K for biotite. In-field magnetic force microscopy on iron bearing phyllosilicates confirmed the paramagnetic response at room temperature, present down to monolayers.

**The Role of Oxygen in Ionic Liquid Gating on 2D Cr2Ge2Te6: a Non-Oxide Material**
Ionic liquid gating can markedly modulate the materials' carrier density so as to induce metallization, superconductivity, and quantum phase transitions. One of the main issues is whether the mechanism of ionic liquid gating is an electrostatic field effect or an electrochemical effect, especially for oxide materials. Recent observation of the suppression of the ionic liquid gate-induced metallization in the presence of oxygen for oxide materials suggests the electrochemical effect. However, in more general scenarios, the role of oxygen in ionic liquid gating effect is still unclear. Here, we perform the ionic liquid gating experiments on a non-oxide material: two-dimensional ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6. Our results demonstrate that despite the large increase of the gate leakage current in the presence of oxygen, the oxygen does not affect the ionic liquid gating effect (&lt; 5 % difference), which suggests the electrostatic field effect as the mechanism on non-oxide materials. Moreover, our results show that the ionic liquid gating is more effective on the modulation of the channel resistances compared to the back gating across the 300 nm thick SiO2.

**Berry curvature induced anomalous Hall conductivity in magnetic topological oxide double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6**
Oxide materials exhibit several novel structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Their stability under ambient conditions, easy synthesis, and high transition temperatures provide such systems with an ideal ground for realizing topological properties and real-life technological applications. However, experimental evidence of topological states in oxide materials is rare. In this study, we have synthesized single crystals of oxide double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 and revealed its topological nature by investigating its structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. We observed that the system crystallized in the cubic space group Fm-3m, which is a half-metallic ferromagnet. Transport measurements show an anomalous Hall effect, and it is evident that the Hall contribution originates from the Berry curvature. Assuming a shift of the Fermi energy towards the conduction band, the contribution of the anomalous Hall effect is enhanced owing to the presence of a gaped nodal line. This study can be used to explore and realize the topological properties of bulk oxide systems.
